i do in fact have a job now, but i only have it bc my mom works there so i had a good reference. i was looking for a job for MONTHS, and i am not even joking when i say i applied for probably around 100 or more jobs at various places, including fast food chains. and i am 23, with experience in retail and the restaurant industry. i got maybe like, 3 calls back, went to interviews (which didn‚Äôt even go ‚Äúbad‚Äù or anything, were pretty standard), and NOTHING. 

i honestly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening but i feel like when i was a teenager with no job experience at all it was easier to get a job, like back then i would get call backs at multiple places.

i‚Äôm lucky i know someone at the place i work at now, bc otherwise i may have been fucked. i was so desperate and applying at the shittiest jobs with the worst pay imaginable (minimum wage is UNDER $9 HERE so some places rlly b paying that) and still, nothing. 

i still notice a lot of people shitting on unemployed people and saying ‚Äújust stop being picky‚Äù or ‚Äúmcdonald‚Äôs is hiring‚Äù - which is, in my experience, bullshit. it‚Äôs not as easy as just walking into a place, getting an interview and securing a job. i‚Äôm convinced either every place is lying when they say they‚Äôre hiring, or they only want to hire teenagers cuz they‚Äôre easier to push around possibly. also, since 2020 probably a lot of businesses cut staff and never return to a ‚Äúfull staff‚Äù or whatever

Eventually I got annoyed and said, ""No! Nothing to eat or drink! Absolutely nothing by mouth at all. It would be very dangerous. No food, no snacks, no crackers, no water, nothing. Nothing by mouth. No.""

Then I made her repeat it back to make sure she understood. She said, ""I understand. I can't eat or drink anything until after the surgery.""

Ten minutes later, when the ambo arrived for transport to the big hospital, I went in and found her throwing a McDonald's wrapper  into the corner and frantically cramming half a hamburger into her mouth.

I said, ""I told you not to eat anything!""

With her mouth full she said, ""Mo ah bibm'! Ah bibm' eep amyffing!""

I said, ""You have mustard on your face.""

That was a fun conversation to have with the surgeon.",370,2025-06-19 16:17:04,nursing,https://reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1lf6maw/npo_patient_can_i_eat_before_my_surgery_i_just/mylymlc/,auraseer

reddit,1litcy6,McDonald‚Äôs Canada likely increased water content in their ice cream,"I'm in Vancouver BC and get the McDonald's cones and sundaes frequently. 

This week I noticed a significant decrease in the quality of the ice cream as it has become very watery, no longer is there any creaminess lingering in the mouth and it melts away super quickly. 

I know the mix comes in a bag premixed from the factory and individual stores don't do reconstitutions, so this is probably a recipe change unless there was a problem at the factory. I know they're doing the annual summer deals and there's no competition at the same price point, but I still find this somewhat disheartening and won't be buying their soft serves much if this is permanent.",21,2025-06-24 03:11:57,fastfood,https://reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/1litcy6/mcdonalds_canada_likely_increased_water_content/,PolishedJar
