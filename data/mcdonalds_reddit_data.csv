reddit,1lj9mvz,“just work at mcdonald’s” is not a valid argument anymore,"I don’t know the specific reasoning, but within the past few years i feel like it has been increasingly more difficult to obtain ANY kind of job, regardless of experience. 

i do in fact have a job now, but i only have it bc my mom works there so i had a good reference. i was looking for a job for MONTHS, and i am not even joking when i say i applied for probably around 100 or more jobs at various places, including fast food chains. and i am 23, with experience in retail and the restaurant industry. i got maybe like, 3 calls back, went to interviews (which didn’t even go “bad” or anything, were pretty standard), and NOTHING. 

i honestly don’t know what’s happening but i feel like when i was a teenager with no job experience at all it was easier to get a job, like back then i would get call backs at multiple places.

i’m lucky i know someone at the place i work at now, bc otherwise i may have been fucked. i was so desperate and applying at the shittiest jobs with the worst pay imaginable (minimum wage is UNDER $9 HERE so some places rlly b paying that) and still, nothing. 

i still notice a lot of people shitting on unemployed people and saying “just stop being picky” or “mcdonald’s is hiring” - which is, in my experience, bullshit. it’s not as easy as just walking into a place, getting an interview and securing a job. i’m convinced either every place is lying when they say they’re hiring, or they only want to hire teenagers cuz they’re easier to push around possibly. also, since 2020 probably a lot of businesses cut staff and never return to a “full staff” or whatever

reddit,mylymlc,"Comment on: NPO Patient: Can I eat before my surgery? I just had McDonald’s like 20 minutes ago, is that okay?”","I had a patient who kept asking, like five times in an hour. She was scheduled for stat appendectomy, so I kept saying no. 

Eventually I got annoyed and said, ""No! Nothing to eat or drink! Absolutely nothing by mouth at all. It would be very dangerous. No food, no snacks, no crackers, no water, nothing. Nothing by mouth. No.""

Then I made her repeat it back to make sure she understood. She said, ""I understand. I can't eat or drink anything until after the surgery.""

Ten minutes later, when the ambo arrived for transport to the big hospital, I went in and found her throwing a McDonald's wrapper  into the corner and frantically cramming half a hamburger into her mouth.

I said, ""I told you not to eat anything!""

With her mouth full she said, ""Mo ah bibm'! Ah bibm' eep amyffing!""

I said, ""You have mustard on your face.""

That was a fun conversation to have with the surgeon.",370,2025-06-19 16:17:04,nursing,https://reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1lf6maw/npo_patient_can_i_eat_before_my_surgery_i_just/mylymlc/,auraseer

Our IV team came in to start her IV and she says “will you get me a glass of water, this nurse absolutely refuses to get me one!” And he told her, “sorry, I can’t do that for you.” I explained to her how dangerous it was, very annoyed at her trying to circumvent safety and act like I was being mean to her. She started screaming “I’m not going anywhere until I get a glass of water!” And repeating it like a crazy woman when the surgeon came in to mark her. He said “can we get her some versed or something?” I give her versed just before transport came so they can peel her off the wall to get her to surgery.

""The anesthesia will likely cause you to vomit and the breathing tube will force all the vomit deep into your lungs. If you're lucky, you'll just get the worst pneumonia you can imagine and spend some time in the ICU on a ventilator followed by a week or two recovering in the hospital then hopefully you don't have permanent lung damage that requires lifelong oxygen. Worst case you just die, we crush all your ribs doing CPR to bring you back, then you die again, and we repeat the cycle until you either end up in the lucky scenario with a bunch of broken ribs or you just die.

O pagamento de subsídio de alimentação não é obrigatório na lei, é uma opção do empregador

Em todos os restaurantes em que trabalhei, era substituído pelas refeições dadas. As regras de valor e possibilidade de combinações variavam e eram definidas pelo dono do restaurante (regime de franchising nos 3 em que trabalhei)

Se o teu irmão está preocupado com a saúde, que leia as tabelas nutricionais que estão disponíveis. No restaurante em que trabalhei mais tempo (já com alguma confiança e autorização), muitas vezes registava um menu e comia só o hambúrguer num prato com a alface e as batatas fritas (difícil de resistir)

The triple cheeseburgers are gone, the chilli cheeseburger is gone... now we get a double fish burger deal. Nobody likes a single fish burger, let alone two of those monstrosities. Or 2 double cheeseburgers and 2 medium fries for over half what the feed the family for four deal cost... 

I won't be ordering from McDonald's for a while at least until they start understanding that most people in the UK can barely afford rent let along a ""treat"" from their restaurants at the moment.

reddit,1litcy6,McDonald’s Canada likely increased water content in their ice cream,"I'm in Vancouver BC and get the McDonald's cones and sundaes frequently. 

This week I noticed a significant decrease in the quality of the ice cream as it has become very watery, no longer is there any creaminess lingering in the mouth and it melts away super quickly. 

I know the mix comes in a bag premixed from the factory and individual stores don't do reconstitutions, so this is probably a recipe change unless there was a problem at the factory. I know they're doing the annual summer deals and there's no competition at the same price point, but I still find this somewhat disheartening and won't be buying their soft serves much if this is permanent.",21,2025-06-24 03:11:57,fastfood,https://reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/1litcy6/mcdonalds_canada_likely_increased_water_content/,PolishedJar
