reddit,1li7rpf,A boomer at Starbucks went on a homophobic rant while ordering,"I went to Starbucks on Friday morning to grab some coffee before work, and in front of me at the counter was a boomer in the middle of a full blown tantrum.

‚ÄúThere used to be just coffee, now there‚Äôs fucking lattes, soy that makes you grow tits, all this bullshit made up by people with blue hair that can‚Äôt tell what their gender is! I just want normal fucking coffee!‚Äù 

The barista asked him what he meant by normal coffee since people apparently get mad when their version of normal coffee isn‚Äôt the same as hers. After a ton of back and forth, he finally said ‚Äúblack, no fucking pansy shit‚Äù and finished his order. 

Dude wasted like 20 minutes of mine and everyone else‚Äôs time when he could‚Äôve just said black coffee. It‚Äôs honestly pretty weird that boomers can‚Äôt stop thinking about trans people for 2 seconds. They‚Äôre fucking obsessed.

reddit,1lg1sqa,TIFU by giving myself a fake name at starbucks‚Ä¶ and forgetting it was me.,"so i (26m) hate giving my real name at starbucks. it‚Äôs not even that weird of a name, but they always mess it up or call out something totally wrong. so i‚Äôve started using fake names just for fun.

a few days ago, i decided to go with ‚Äúderek.‚Äù no real reason, just felt like a derek kind of day.

i place the order, they say ‚Äúthanks, derek.‚Äù and i sit down to wait. about 3 minutes later, the barista yells out: ‚Äúiced vanilla latte for derek!‚Äù

i don‚Äôt move.

he calls again, louder: ‚ÄúDEREK!‚Äù

i‚Äôm just sitting there like ‚Äúwhere the hell is this derek guy?‚Äù

then another customer turns to me and goes, ‚Äúhey man, aren‚Äôt you derek?‚Äù

i just stared at him. full mental blank.

‚ÄúOH SH\*T. I‚ÄôM DEREK.‚Äù

i scrambled up to get the drink, muttered something like ‚Äúlong day,‚Äù and walked out with the most embarrassed sip of my life.

i don‚Äôt even like vanilla lattes. i panicked and picked the first thing on the menu.

tl;dr: gave a fake name at starbucks, forgot i was that person, sat there confused until someone reminded me i‚Äôm the idiot who made up ‚Äúderek.‚Äù",1300,2025-06-20 17:07:43,tifu,https://reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1lg1sqa/tifu_by_giving_myself_a_fake_name_at_starbucks/,serenologic

From what I understand and from the data they came up with, men who drink instant coffee, like home-made or McDonald's, are more reserved and easygoing and tend to be older. The Starbucks and Dutch Bros drinkers were more outgoing, younger, and/or tried to act younger.

reddit,1lh8zlo,"Starbucks needs to stop being so ""fine text"" about caffeine in refreshers","There are people with caffeine sensitivities and heart problems. Refreshers should be advertised with their caffeine content more boldly. Clearly with all the vibrant fruity colors and boba make it the first thing that a kid is going to see on the menu. As a barista every time I tell a customer it's caffeinated, they are mind-blown. I just wonder how many people could be having unidentified health problems or think their kid has chronic ADHD while completely oblivious that it's simply their daily starbucks fruit juice. 

We can also blame the customer for not reading more closely. But lets also acknowledge that Starbucks knows they could do better. It's common sense to assume that coffee has caffeine, but it is not normal to expect people to assume some colorful fruit juice is caffeinated. The caffeine info is very easy to miss and it should not be easy to miss.",430,2025-06-22 04:17:45,starbucks,https://reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1lh8zlo/starbucks_needs_to_stop_being_so_fine_text_about/,Leenolyak

But also, and I say this as someone who has to avoid coffee for health reasons, starbucks is a coffee shop. It's not a juice bar it's not a boba shop it's not that weird mormon soda thing. It's a coffee shop. People should expect most if not all drinks to have coffee or tea and most of those to be caffeinated. All of the small coffee shops I've been to have like maybe 1-3 herbal teas or water as their only non caffeinated beverages, and hot chocolate as a truly low caffiene option. I'm not saying that it's good or that coffee shops shouldn't have more caffiene free options (my sister is diabetic and has caffiene issues so extra shoutout to the small handful of cafes that will do a sugar free italian soda for her) but it is the industry norm and people should probably not assume anything is caffiene free at a coffee shop",42,2025-06-22 04:37:18,starbucks,https://reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1lh8zlo/starbucks_needs_to_stop_being_so_fine_text_about/mz2bhaw/,Scared-Alfalfa1237

reddit,1ljs545,UPDATE: AITA for wanting to uninvite my sister-in-law from my wedding because she keeps undermining my wedding planning?,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/t84DQCeZbZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/t84DQCeZbZ)

First of all I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who read my original post and offered their judgements and advice. Writing this out really helped me process what I was feeling and hearing that I wasn‚Äôt overreacting or just being hormonal from people that are removed from the situation was very comforting. I read every single comment and there is no way to express how much all the kind words meant to me. There were lots and lots of comments asking for an update, but I wanted to wait until after I had talked to Nate.

I spent last night at Sam‚Äôs house and mostly ignored Nate‚Äôs texts and calls. Kayla texted me once also telling me to not let my hormones make me irrational. I just blocked her, but someone advised to unblock and just silence her notifications so if she escalates, I could maybe use it in court for my custody case. I did unblock her, earlier today (and I‚Äôm glad I did. But we‚Äôll get there). 

I replied to Nate at one point last night telling him that I was safe and at Sam‚Äôs house and that I would be home tomorrow (today) after work to talk about everything. I expressed again that I was feeling really hurt about not being heard or backed up by him and that I needed time to decide what I wanted to do. He asked what I meant by that, if I meant canceling the wedding altogether. I told him that is exactly what I was considering. His reply? ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let your hormones make you do something irrational. We‚Äôll talk tomorrow.‚Äù 

Anyone else want to take a guess as to where he got that line? That just about made my decision for me. I didn‚Äôt reply, not even when he texted me ‚Äúgood night, I love you.‚Äù Instead, before I went to bed for the night, I sent him a link to my post and told him to read through it before we talk. Someone said he probably sent it to Kayla, too. If she did read it, she hasn‚Äôt commented and if she texted me about it, it was while I had her blocked. 

This morning, I called in to work and had breakfast with Sam. She gave me the number of a family lawyer that her friend used for his custody case. I spoke to the assistant, explained my situation, and luckily, she had a slot open after lunch for an initial consult. So I took a shower and basically just kept reading through the comments on my post until it was time to talk to her. 

I told the lawyer exactly why I am leaving Nate and how I am terrified over how his sister would influence him with our baby. I don‚Äôt trust him to not be influenced by Kayla and to have our baby‚Äôs best interest in mind, so I want to fight for sole custody and supervised visitation. I told her, if possible, I want to include something that restricts Kayla from having any contact with my child. I am already mentally preparing to have to fight Nate in court, because I know he will not agree to any of this. My lawyer told me that while my concerns are valid, it may be difficult to convince a judge to put a contact restriction in the custody order based on family drama alone. She advised me to document everything Kayla has done and anything moving forward so we can present it to the judge if and when we end up in court. She gave me a list of things to think about, like if I want Nate to get any custody at all or just visitation, how I want to handle things like medical care or education for my child, if I want to put communication restrictions, like only talking over text. Lots of things I never would have thought of and never thought I would have to think of. We were supposed to do all of this together. 

She told me to take a few days to gather my thoughts and decide on what I want. I scheduled an in-person meeting for this Friday to go over everything. Hopefully I will have my mind straight by then, but if anyone has any advice when it comes to what to put on these custody papers, I‚Äôm all ears. 

After the phone call with my lawyer, I checked some more comments and then took a much needed nap. When I woke up, I had a text from Nate asking what time I would be off work so he could have dinner ready for me when I get home. I told him I would be there around 5, but if Kayla is there, I will be turning around and leaving without a word. I then asked him if he read the post I sent him. He said ‚ÄúI did. But I would rather talk to you than read you bash me and my sister on the internet with a bunch of strangers. Don‚Äôt worry, I told Kayla she‚Äôs not welcome.‚Äù This pissed me off beyond belief. Clearly he either didn‚Äôt read the post, or still doesn‚Äôt realize how truly in the wrong they are here. Either way, I lost all motivation to try and talk to work things out. I‚Äôm just done. 

I texted him ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about dinner. All I will be doing is gathering some more things and dropping off my lawyer‚Äôs contact info. There‚Äôs nothing more for us to discuss.‚Äù 

He asked what I meant, what lawyer, and told me he‚Äôs been waiting to talk about this. All I said was ‚Äúfine‚Äù. 

Sam wished me luck before I left and assured me I was welcome back once we were done talking. I told her I absolutely would be back and thanked her for everything so far. Then, I stopped and got one of those boba refreshers from Starbucks to calm my nerves before I went home.

When I got home, Nate had dinner ready just like he said. I ignored him and just went straight to our room to pack up some more of my clothes and toiletries. He tried asking me if I really wasn‚Äôt going to talk to him, but I just ignored him for the time being. Just seeing his face made my anger flare up and I wanted to be smart about our discussion. After a while, he gave up and just went to eat in the dining room. 

When I was finished I went and sat with him at the table, but didn‚Äôt touch any of the food. I started a voice memo on my phone before I said, ‚ÄúGo ahead.‚Äù He looked at me all confused so I told him he was the one that wanted to talk and must have so much to say. So, Go ahead. 

He stumbled over his words for a while but ultimately started off with an apology, trying to tell me he didn‚Äôt realize I was so upset with Kayla‚Äôs behavior. I asked him if he remembered how hard I cried after I got home from dress shopping because of her comments about my choices and my body. If he remembered having to talk to her about not being my maid of honor. If he remembered our conversation just a few days ago, where I told him *canceling my venue that held so much sentiment to me* was way too far over the line. He said he did each time and tried to add a ‚Äúbut‚Äù to argue, but I just cut him off with my next example. I told him that after all of that, he 100% should have known I was beyond done with her b*llsh*t. I told him I was so hurt and pissed that I wanted her uninvited. But he wanted to give her another chance? To what? Cancel our DJ and book a live band? Dye my dress red or show up in white herself? He told me she would never do that. I told him he told me she would never cancel my venue, but then she admitted to it in front of our faces. I told him I don‚Äôt trust his opinion on his sister and that he is just as delusional as she if he thinks she will change. 

I asked him why he even told her so many details of our wedding anyway. Why does her opinion for *our* wedding even matter? 

He tried to tell me that because Kayla didn‚Äôt get to have a real wedding when she got married, she was just a little too excited about ours. I told him she has all the right in the world to be excited. But that does not give her any rights to insult or change our choices regarding what we want for our wedding. She‚Äôll have plenty of opportunities to have a real wedding. If she could stop for two seconds and take her nose out of our wedding business, she could go out and find a man or woman to marry herself. (Poor soul whoever that may be.)

I asked him, what‚Äôs next? She gets to name our baby since she lost her own? The look on his face made my stomach feel hollow. He told me, and I quote, ‚Äúactually, Kayla does have a few ideas for what we could name our daughter.‚Äù 

*Daughter!?*

Side note: I had mentioned in a comment previously that we were waiting to be surprised about the gender of our baby. We were discussing baby names and had settled on the top three for each gender. We agreed to keep them to ourselves until the baby is born. 

I asked if he said ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù and he looked like a deer caught in my headlights. He backtracked but I pressed the issue. I asked him flat out if he knows the gender of our baby. He hesitated, but ultimately confessed to remembering that I filled out an information release form at my first OB visit, so he called the office and asked them for the results of our gender scan, claiming that we changed our minds and he was going to do a reveal for me. I feel absolutely sick and violated. I asked him what the fuck he was thinking. He said Kayla was feeling left out since Sam was planning my baby shower and not including her and that *she just couldn‚Äôt wait* to find out. 

I demanded he tell me everything. What else has he gone behind my back to do? Did he give her the idea to pretend to be our wedding planner? Was he the one that had her cancel my venue and change our catering? He tried to tell me no, of course not. She did that on her own. But I could just *tell* that he was lying. He absolutely put her up to all of this. At that point I didn‚Äôt even care why he did. It‚Äôs clear that none of *our* decisions will ever actually be ours. He will always do whatever the hell he wants to and get Kayla to back him up. I don‚Äôt even want to think about how many of ‚Äúour‚Äù decisions in the past were completely undermined and changed by these two. 

I asked him, if Kayla came to him and told him everything I‚Äôm telling him. That she doesn‚Äôt feel supported by her partner. The her partner went behind her back to learn the gender of their baby without her. That her partner was retroactively, changing every decision that they had agreed upon. That her partner was letting their sibling bully her relentlessly, what would he say to her? He didn‚Äôt have a response and honestly, if he did, I didn‚Äôt want to hear it anymore. I knew the answer. 

I told him that as the woman who is supposed to be his wife, me and the baby I am carrying should be his top priority, not his twin sister. I said him going behind my back like this for something as important as the gender of our baby is absolutely unforgivable. There is nothing that he can say or do to fix this now. I told him I will no longer be marrying him, but it‚Äôs up to him if he wants to cancel all the vendors. I said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre more than welcome to use it all to marry Kayla, seeing as she‚Äôs the one you obviously care the most about.‚Äù 

He tried to backtrack and apologize and explain, but every time I just cut him off and told him that I had heard enough, and my mind was made up. There is no going back now. If he wants to have even the slimmest chance to get me back and have a real relationship with our baby, he will need to attend some serious therapy and do a lot of work on himself and his relationship with Kayla. I told him no woman in her right mind would ever marry him while he was this enmeshed with her. I told him that any contact we have moving forward will be through my lawyer. I want nothing to do with his family, and if I get what I want, they will have nothing to do with my *daughter* because I‚Äôll be damned if I let him subject her to this treatment. I put my lawyer‚Äôs name and phone number on the table and walked out. He didn‚Äôt try to follow me. 

So now, on top of dealing with my lawyer for the custody case, do I have to file a complaint with my OB office? Are they allowed to just give him this information without my express consent? Or did me stupidly putting him on the information release form I signed give them blanket consent to share any and all information with him? God I didn‚Äôt think this could get any worse, but I guess that‚Äôs on me for being naive. 

I‚Äôm glad I recorded the conversation, though, and got him admitting to doing all of this. I don‚Äôt know how or if it will help my custody case, but I sent it to my lawyer with a note that we can discuss more on Friday. 

I‚Äôm back at Sam‚Äôs place now. She was already at work when I got back, but I texted her to wake me up when she gets home. I need my sister. 

I also called my mom and told her everything that‚Äôs happened so far. She cried with me for a while and then asked me if I needed her to do anything. I asked her if she‚Äôd be willing to go to the house with Sam and get the rest of my stuff because I do not want to see Nate right now. Just picturing his face is making me feel sick. She said she is more than willing. 

Kayla did text me again. I‚Äôm assuming Nate talked to her after I left. It was a very long, cruel message that I don‚Äôt want to repeat here. I can post a screenshot if anyone cares for the whole message (If I can figure out how to attach one) But to summarize she just called me a delusional control freak who can‚Äôt let Nate make any decisions for himself and insulted my venue choice once again. And then said that she hopes my baby is stillborn because I don‚Äôt deserve to be a mother. Honestly, I after reading it, I thought the message would hurt, but it just gave me a really good laugh. I took a screenshot and sent it to my lawyer as well.

And that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at. The wedding is off. I will call all the vendors tomorrow and see if we can get any deposits back. If not, I‚Äôll let them know to contact Nate and Kayla to see if they would like to keep things as planned. Let them throw a party for all I care. But I will be canceling my venue regardless of my refund. Neither of them are going to step foot in that sacred place if I can help it.

I didn‚Äôt realize how much I was letting this weigh on me until now. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, even though a new one is settling very quickly. Writing everything out like this is truly so freaking helpful for me to process how I‚Äôm feeling and what I need to do. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll keep doing formal updates, but for anyone who is interested, maybe I‚Äôll just treat this profile like a little journal as this all unfolds. Thank you again to everyone for all your advice and for showing me that I‚Äôm not crazy.",4051,2025-06-25 06:18:47,AITAH,https://reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ljs545/update_aita_for_wanting_to_uninvite_my/,ThrowRA-62758

I hope her statement gives some weight to your argument that she shouldn't have contact with the baby and that Nate isn't responsible,  coherent,  and so many other words I want to say that will get me trouble, enough to care for a child.

Make custody a total fucking nightmare for him. First he will have to find you out of state. Then don‚Äôt put his name on the birth certificate and make him petition for a paternity test.

reddit,1lh2dw9,Terrible experience at Starbucks,"I just had a really upsetting experience at a local Starbucks and I wanted to share it here to ask if anyone knows how to formally escalate a complaint about poor customer service.

I went to collect my Too Good To Go bag as usual and showed the app to the staff member. I swiped to confirm pickup right in front of her. Instead of acknowledging the order, she snapped, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no Too Good To Go today.‚Äù I politely said ‚ÄúThe app allowed me to order one bag, how could I get a refund?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt respond at all‚Äîinstead, she turned her back to me, grabbed three identical items off the shelf, threw in a random cake (not listed in the bag), and literally tossed the bag at me without a word. And she start to serve the next customer. 

The way she treated me made me feel humiliated‚Äîas if I were begging for leftovers rather than collecting something I‚Äôd paid for. I‚Äôve used Too Good To Go many times before and have always had good experiences, but this was shockingly rude and unprofessional.

Does anyone know the best way to formally report this to Starbucks corporate or Too Good To Go? I believe both companies should be made aware of how this store is treating customers.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

**AITA for giving my friend first aid on a sensitive area?**

**Originally posted to r/AmItheAsshole**

[BoRU 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/s/eMAcSDAzvd)  **Posted by u/wormhole222** 

**Thanks to u/justanotheracct33 for finding the update**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Accusations of sexual assault, false accusations, bodily injury!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/jzvGiaL3bv/)  **June 16, 2022**

This happened the other day. i (23M) was at a pool party at my best friend Greg's house. there was also a slip n' slide set up and people were using it. my friend Amy used it and screamed. the whole party turns to her and shes clutching her breast and theres blood just pouring out of her hand. she had slid over a rock and cut herself. I'm in nursing school so i run over to her and ask to see the cut. she pulls her hand away and i see that it doesn't look too serious but it definitely needs attention. I turn to greg and ask him if he has a first aid kit and he says yes, in the bathroom inside the house,

So i walk Amy into the house and grab the first aid kit. I pause for a second and ask her if shes okay with me helping her with this or if she wants to do it herself because of where the cut is and she says ""no i trust you and i want your help"" so we go into the bathroom and wash out the cut, i look at it more closely to make sure it isnt serious. i put some Neosporin on it and bandage it up nicely. Amy thanks me and we go back outside

A couple women come up to Amy and ask if shes okay and one of them, Sarah, gives me a dirty look and they kinda lead her away. i go back to where i was sitting and greg sits next to me and says ""some people were talking shit out here. i did my best to defend you but i figured you should know that they were talking shit about you helping Amy"" i asked him what he meant and he said that Sarah was saying it was creepy how i ""sprung into action when i saw an opportunity to play with a boob"" and a few of the other women and one guy agreed and were making fun of me. I was pretty upset about that but i didnt want to make a scene so i just ignored it for the time being

Later that day though i was sitting by the fire pit and Sarah was sitting across from me and nobody else was around the area so i asked her why she was making fun of me for helping Amy. she said ""i guess that was a little mean of me. Im sorry that i did that. but i just thought it was kinda weird how you saw her boob was hurt and you ran up to her and insisted to help. i know you're in nursing school but i think you should have let a girl handle it. we all know first aid too"". i thanked her for her apology and i dont like confrontation so i just said ""alright i guess ill keep that in mind from now on""

‚Äã**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**

EDIT: i stepped away to go to work and this post blew up. thank you all for your judgements. i think i did the right thing by helping her in this situation and sarah was really kind of a bitch here. also i realized that Amy might not know that they were talking shit about me so i'm going to call or text her and inform her about all this

EDIT2: UPDATE: i called Amy. asked her how the cut was healing. she said it was healing well and she was keeping an eye on it. then i asked her if she knew about the things Sarah and the others said about me and what Sarah said at the fire pit. Amy had no idea. she said the other women were asking her if she was okay and what happened and all that but she assumed they were worried about the injury. not my helping her. and Amy was absolutely pissed and went to the friend group chat and tore the people that were shit talking a new asshole, especially Sarah. Sarah and the others apologized to me in the group chat but Amy kept going and said i shouldn't accept their apologies because they sat back and talked shit on the one person who stepped up and helped her. Amy also asked Greg not to invite Sarah to the next pool party and Greg readily agreed. a few of the others tried to say that was too far but Amy just told them to shut the fuck up and do something next time someone's hurt instead of sitting on their ass and insulting me.

**UPDATE after the original BoRU**

[UPDATE: AITA for giving my friend first aid on a sensitive area?](https://www.reddit.com/u/yuppiefortheguppies/s/lT831XvrPX)  **July 5, 2022 (19 days later)**

link to original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vdnkh6/aita\_for\_giving\_my\_friend\_first\_aid\_on\_a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vdnkh6/aita_for_giving_my_friend_first_aid_on_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

So that last post blew up real hard. i saw it on [r/BestofRedditorUpdates](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/) and on tiktok. came back to this account and had like 20 followers. and i realized enough stuff happened and there was probably enough of a demand for an update post

Greg followed through on not inviting Sarah to the next party. she was upset about it but accepted it. then two days after that party she called me and asked if we could meet in person and talk. i said okay and we met at a starbucks. She looked really sad and apologized to me profusely. she said that she doesnt know why she said those things about me. she thinks she was ashamed of being frozen in fear when Amy got hurt and she just took out that shame on me by insulting me. but that it was incredibly fucked up to do because accusations like the ones she threw at me, even if they were ""jokes"", could ruin my entire career and it was so wrong of her to do that just because she was ashamed of herself. she seemed genuinely remorseful so i forgave her and we are friends again. i told her i would talk to greg about letting her back into the parties but she said not to. what she did was ""super fucked"" and she doesnt want to come back until Amy forgives her too. i said okay. we hugged and i went on my merry way.

a couple of days after that im hanging out with Amy at my house and we talk about the Sarah situation.. i showed Amy the previous post and asked her if we should show the others. she said yeah. so i showed everyone including sarah and she was a little upset at first but quickly accepted it.

Amy forgave sarah a few days after that and she was invited to the 4th of july party two days ago (on the 3rd) and we had a great time. sarah was a little awkward at first at this party but quickly cheered up once we assured her that the ""drama"" was behind us and we accepted her apology and quickly moved on to joking about it. including sarah pretending to slice open her boob with the dull side of a butter knife, saying ""Hark! mine tender breast! it doth been sliced open like a ripe melon! whoms't ever will save me?"", ripping off her bikini top and leaping into my lap. which, to be really honest here, firmly put the issue to bed because everyone at the party was laughing for a good hour about that.

So yeah. everything worked out in the end really. i just wanted to put a cork in this story because when i saw it on tiktok i realized how much people enjoyed it and thought it would be prudent to let people know that it had a definitive ending

TL;DR: things worked out, we are all friends again. they might be in the comments of this post

reddit,1lfkrwc,A lack of solidarity will kill this movement,"This subreddit advocates nonviolence. Fine. But first, I want you to listen.
 
The general goal of those here, and in other communities, subreddits, local groups, etc. Is to resist fascism. I think we can all agree on that, right? So with that in mind. With the goal of resisting, and removing fascism being *The* important thing, we need to have a talk about what that looks like. 
 
Mayors, governors, Elected officials, the police, are all going to say ""Please keep it peaceful,"" and some of you may choose to do so. I certainly don't want to get arrested and spend time in jail. 
 
But here's the thing, I'm not going to tell someone else, how to protest. If someone else [redacted] a Starbucks window? I am not going to video them. If the cops ask me to identify who threw a water bottle at them from the crowd? I took my glasses off to clean them. Sorry, didn't see. The only thing I'm going to do, is help those who don't want to be involved with alternative actions get to safety. Because the only way we get past this, the only way we get through this? Is together. 
 
You might agree with your friends tactics, you might not. But you shouldn't force them to obey YOUR risk tolerance, just like they shouldn't force you to participate in [redacted].
 
So, be kind to one another, show solidarity, work together, cover your face, and don't talk to the cops. 
 
I love you. 
 
EDIT: I believe I may have been misinterpreted. 
 
I am not advocating for violence. What I am getting at, is:
- if someone else, another protest in the same area, direct action, etc, decides that THEY want to engage in alternative tactics. Don't police their actions, nor should you document their actions/report them. If they are fighting against fascism, they are on your side. 
- Be careful, as the police very well may escalate force for the smallest transgression. It could be mot moving fast enough, it could also be a water bottle. Those who are not new to the protest world will tell you, they WANT to be there. ICE wants to be there. Don't *give* them a reason, but be prepared if/when they do escalate
- if you choose to use alternative tactics, do so away from the peaceful protest. 
- if you're the peaceful protest, KEEP IT UP. 
 
Don't stop others from living their truth, don't narc on those on your side, love your neighbors and friends, and family, and partners. ",2562,2025-06-20 01:42:11,50501,https://reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1lfkrwc/a_lack_of_solidarity_will_kill_this_movement/,Gvineprotoge

reddit,1lhvhg5,My coworker has access to my fidelity..I never authorized this and all my money is gone‚Ä¶I‚Äôve worked with them 3 years ago..,"Hi, so today I got curious about my 401K and wanted to check it in fidelity. I logged in and it did the usual two step authorization then I saw a number I don‚Äôt recognize. ‚ÄúXxx-xxx-1236‚Äù I only ever had a number ending in ‚Äú5874‚Äù(fake). I logged in and saw everything was completely empty. 401K completely gone. Starbucks stock plan completely empty. I was thinking maybe it was a glitch and opened and closed the app still empty. I called customer service and I asked them about the unknown number and they read it out loud to me and it was in the same zip code as I was and I looked it up on my messages and it was my SUPERVISORS NUMBER!! Mind you I haven‚Äôt worked with them in over 3 years and I have never even given them my social medias or anything except my phone number. I knew she was a trouble maker and she got fired eventually. I don‚Äôt know how she got ahold of my social security or even bypassed this stuff. If she actually emptied my accounts by somehow getting my social security from work, what can I do!???? 

note: I am getting deployed next month and worried I won‚Äôt have enough time for a lawyer. I have worked at Starbucks before I joined the army and left it 2 months before I went to basic. 

Tomorrow I am contacting fidelity since they are closed on weekends. Will update!!

reddit,1lf4mez,Starbucks ‚ÄúPup Cups‚Äù unhygienic?,"So I was going through YouTube today, and my algorithm often brings up dog videos because I enjoy commenting and letting dog nutters know that the whole world does not love your mutts . But anyway this video popped up on my shorts of a collage of videos of dogs reacting to getting pup cups at the Starbucks drive through. Some were crying when they got to the line because they wanted a cup so bad, others were snarling when the owner tried to take the cup away. And what I noticed about all of this is the barista at the window always hand fed these cups to the dogs. From there hand to there mouth directly and sometimes pet them afterwards.

Some of these dogs were literally dropping globs of drool from there mouth in anticipation of getting there's and you know darn well the window person probably got some slobber on there's hands. I recently just became a fan of Starbucks. I had it for the first time a month ago and have been a regular since and I had no idea they do this. My closest Starbucks doesn't have a drive thru so I have never seen this. However when I do go through a drive thru and I seen this happen, I will make a big dramatic Karen deal on checking to see if the person handling my order washed his hands with soap profusely before touching any of my food or drinks. 

You know when the lines are busy the workers are probably not taking a break to wash there hands for 30 secs-1 minute to clean off germs.This is so nasty to me. Is there not some kind of health code against food workers hand feeding dogs then immediately touching food for human consumption after? I'm seriously disgusted by this.

Starbucks encourages dog owners and their dogs to visit.  It‚Äôs disgusting.  I‚Äôve seen a dog enjoying his cup sitting on a chair at the table inside a Starbucks with its owner.

The last time I was in Starbucks, some woman came in with her dog, and immediately the dog spread its legs and peed all over the floor.  The owner attempted to clean it up using those brown napkins.  She dripped all the way to the garbage several times until an employee came out with a mop.  I had to finally look away because I lost my appetite.

I spoke privately with my manager about this and proposed that I be able to spend some time off the floor with each of my trainees, just going over drink recipes, routines, the categories on the cash register & where to find things, etc. My manager was more than happy to accommodate this request. I purposely carved time out with both trainees for this purpose and while one may not have really ‚Äúneeded‚Äù it, it definitely couldn‚Äôt hurt and moreover I did not want the other person to feel singled out. Outside of the stressful environment where we were waiting on actual customers in real time, it was much easier for both of my trainees to download information and make connections between the tasks/procedures they were being taught and the customer experience they wanted to provide.

reddit,1lewvtg,"Do you think Starbucks is considered a fast food chain? Yes, no or both and why?","Not sure if this has been asked on Reddit or anywhere so here goes nothing!

Fellow partner here (almost five years). I want to ask the Reddit community, SBux partners, customers or who ever reads this, I want to know your opinion or preference. 
I once had a quarrel with another partner who was a shift at the time (a year or two ago) on the floor and I made the comment that Starbucks is to me a ‚Äúfast food place‚Äù. She quickly said ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not!‚Äù with a slight giggle after saying those words, she probably thought I was kidding or being funny. She was serious and I was also serious at the time when this took place. My only reason at that moment was because we have a drive thru and I‚Äôve always seen places growing up with drive thru‚Äôs is considered a fast food place. 
Now, I‚Äôm aware some restaurants have places with a drive thru or not like our company (like cafes and reserve stores). I‚Äôm also aware different places have different ways to prep food and have a standard. I have a list in my head what I would consider fast food and another list that can be considered but have different altercations of not being a fast food category. 
I believe SBux was not intending to be what it is today over fifty years ago. It was a cafe, with just drinks and no drive thru yet. (Of course we are going back to the Starbucks experience, different topic later)
My personal opinion has slightly changed but I want to get y‚Äôall‚Äôs insight before I say mine. If anyone has questions, myself or others can answer following into the ‚ÄúAre we or are we not a fast food place?‚Äù.


(Side note: I know we have benefits and the ASU program, stocks etc which could be one of the big differences. I‚Äôm aware we have Starbucks outside the United States which is probably a completely different thing over in their countries compared to us. So again, these can add into the topic of opinions or preferences)",17,2025-06-19 05:44:46,starbucks,https://reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1lewvtg/do_you_think_starbucks_is_considered_a_fast_food/,Scared-Form-8899

People outside the U.S. rarely rev match and their clutches still last hundreds of thousands of kilometers. Daily driving isn‚Äôt motorsport and your clutch isn‚Äôt made of wet paper. Just drive normally and enjoy the ride.

Save the fancy footwork for when it actually matters.

Edit-
Currently fighting for my life in these comments having discussions with Vin Petrols and Paul Runners thinking it‚Äôs absolutely NECESSARY to blip the throttle when downshifting. Most people know how it works, we just don‚Äôt bother on our daily commute. It‚Äôs not that deep Dale Earnhardt.

Second edit-
All of you claiming it saves your clutch, I‚Äôm willing to bet some of you are the type of person to needlessly blip your throttle 16 times while reversing while having your clutch slip just to let people hear you drive a manual. You know who you are.",920,2025-06-22 12:47:01,ManualTransmissions,https://reddit.com/r/ManualTransmissions/comments/1lhhzft/psa_from_an_european_youre_wasting_your_time_and/,Lumanus

It's also just what I'm used to doing during normal driving so it's more efficient for me as I don't have to think about anything while doing it.

I do not heel-toe though.",124,2025-06-22 14:16:45,ManualTransmissions,https://reddit.com/r/ManualTransmissions/comments/1lhhzft/psa_from_an_european_youre_wasting_your_time_and/mz4grdw/,edcboye

You should be able to get a women's DJ in a reasonable amount of time.  There will likely be a wait, but it probably isn't going to be the same wait as something like a Submariner or anything like that.  That story changes if she wants an OP instead of a DJ - especially something in a hot color like candy pink or lavender or turquoise.",4,2025-06-24 07:30:28,rolex,https://reddit.com/r/rolex/comments/1liyuvg/starbucks_for_me_now_what_for_the_wife/mzfvaxm/,StickyPenguin120
