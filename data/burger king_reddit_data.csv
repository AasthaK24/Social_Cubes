Though I do feel conflicted about this just because I have been on both sides of this before. 

It honestly feels hard to enjoy things when people constantly complain about stuffs that you don‚Äôt exactly find any issue about. On the other hand, it‚Äôs also terrible when you genuinely have certain problems with the game, talk about them only to get completely shut down by the forced positivity.

Despite generally finding our community pretty wholesome and helpful most of the time I spent here, reddit can be such an echo chamber sometimes.",1446,2025-06-23 21:55:54,Genshin_Impact,https://reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1likby5/im_glad_that_the_number_of_users_who_are/mzcqflr/,MsTea032403

So we are left with more positive people who either enjoyed what has been happening recently and/or the people who don't think Natlan was a deal-breaker or even actually enjoyed it, despite the criticism it faced

Plus, Genshin being a bit more merciful with the Sanctifying Elixirs and the Dust of Enlightenment, plus Nod-Krai is probably helping",638,2025-06-23 21:49:40,Genshin_Impact,https://reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1likby5/im_glad_that_the_number_of_users_who_are/mzcp3hi/,Quibilash
reddit,mzctqct,Comment on: I'm glad that the number of users who are genuinely enjoying Genshin has increased recently.,"There's a nuance that these posts (well, mainly the comments imo) lose pretty quickly. Complaining isn't inherently bad. It tends to come from a place of love. You care about a series and want it to be better so you point out the negatives and what disappointed you. this game isn't perfect and has many problems, that's okay to acknowledge while still liking it! This is a game that wants your time and for you to spend money, it makes sense why people want it to be better.¬†

Maybe I have selective memory but when I was a child it didn't seem that bad.

I don't eat fast food much if at all these days, but Burger King was the worst burger chain. It's a shame because their product if delivered correctly would be quite good. The ""flame grilled"" patties would be superior to the McDonald's or Wendy's ones for example.

Nobody used to want to work there so they were allowed to bring in staff from India on visas. However they were then placed on the stand down list for visas for breaching minimum wage laws.

reddit,1liogu5,KFC & Burger King Zwolle,"Hallo iedereen. Normaal ben ik niet zo van het klagen en dit is ook misschien niet de juiste plek om dat te doen, maar ik wil het toch even van me af schrijven. 

Hoe is het toch in godsnaam mogelijk dat wanneer ik bij de KFC of Burger King in Zwolle kom, er praktisch ALTIJD iets mis gaat met mijn bestelling! Gewoon echt niet overdreven, 9 van de 10 keer gaat het mis. Ondanks dat ik minstens 30 tot 45 minuten moet wachten. En niet alleen dat, maar het eten is ook vaak koud/lauw en slordig bereid. De tafels/vloer zijn vaak vies en plakkerig. Toiletten uiteraard nog viezer. En als je na het eten misschien behoefte hebt aan een ijsje, hou er dan maar rekening mee dat je ook daar weer een half uur op staat te wachten. Een stelletje %+¬£^+* zijn het!!

Nadat ik van beide restaurants de google reviews op zocht, was ik nog verbaasder; Zo onge√´venaard slecht!!! 90% ontevreden mensen. Worden die managers daar niet op de vingers getikt door het hoofdkantoor ofzo? KFC en Burger King mogen zich de ogen uit de kop schamen voor deze twee vestigingen. Hoe bestaaaaat dit?

Zo dat ben ik even kwijt. ",18,2025-06-24 00:02:44,Zwolle,https://reddit.com/r/Zwolle/comments/1liogu5/kfc_burger_king_zwolle/,Prestigious_Ad_4911

Dan zie je hoe eindelijk de zak met jouw bestelling neergezet worden, staan er drie pubers naar te kijken, komt er na 10 minuten een vierde bij staan die na 90 seconden pas besluit dat het moment daar is om op het scherm jouw nummer op te roepen.¬†


Maar goed, dan blijkt de bestelling natuurlijk w√©√©r niet te kloppen, en dan zijn ze nog 25 minuten bezig met dit te corrigeren (inclusief duidelijk maken wat er niet klopt wat nog best lastig is als de andere partij geen reet ge√Ønteresseerd is in het product) terwijl het laatste vet in de rest van je bestelling stolt.¬†


En dit alles zonder een zweem van interesse, vriendelijkheid of basale omgangsvormen zoals echt oogcontact. Volgens mij krijgen ze straf als ze glimlachen.

reddit,1ljtqjm,Burger King on 41st near Best Buy,"This is absolutely the worst managed fast food place I have ever been to.  

It‚Äôs too bad because it used to be one of the best.  I have been going there since I moved to SF 13 years ago.

This evening around 7pm, I went through the drive through.  No one else was in line.  I pulled up to the speaker and was greeted and told they would be with me in a minute.  While waiting, another car pulled in the other lane and received the same message I did.  After a minute or two, they came back and took the order from the car that pulled in after me.  This is highly annoying as it is the third time in the last 8 months this has happened.  One time, they served 3 cars in the other lane before getting to me.  This has never happened at any other drive through.

After being skipped I decided to back up and go inside to complain and try to figure out why this was happening.

I was greeted at the counter and I asked to speak to a manager.  Worker A said he was management and so was worker B who came around to the counter as well.  I explained the situation and the first thing out of workers A mouth was that they did not even try to keep track of who was first as he had to watch drive through and the counter.  I immediately knew the people were the problem.  

I then explained that this was terrible customer service and that this does not happen at other drive through places.  Worker B then told me I ‚Äúyou should just get out of here and go‚Äù.   I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh and knew there was no chance of being reasonable with this pair of supposed management who had absolutely no idea of customer service.

Not once did either of them apologize or try to appease me in any way.

So they have lost a customer of 13 years by being idiots.

I will figure out who owns this place and contact them. If you have this info please post in a reply and whatever you do, please do not give these inconsiderate people your business as they obviously don‚Äôt give a shit.  

Thanks for listening.",0,2025-06-25 07:37:24,SiouxFalls,https://reddit.com/r/SiouxFalls/comments/1ljtqjm/burger_king_on_41st_near_best_buy/,ProfessionalLynx1141
