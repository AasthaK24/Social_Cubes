reddit,1lkqeab,Nintendo is forcing intermission tracks in Mario Kart World online now,"When you select random in the online mode, the random track will be an intermission track to the track.

https://x.com/ValuableIn/status/1938052190771233226

I understand that there are some folks who like the intermission tracks. The vast majority doesn't which is why people where voting for random on online mode because this used to force track laps only. Usually ~~8 to 12~~ 20ish people in my lobbies would vote random, clearly indicating that the vast majority want the track laps only races. To me that makes sense because the tracks are all fantastic. 

With the most recent patch, selecting random will force people into intermission tracks. The only way to play track laps only is now by playing the VS mode against bots or joining a competitive Mario Kart lobby.

This might kill the game for me. I personally dislike the knockout tour and intermission tracks because they are boring to me which is why I wished we get an extra mode. Next to knock out and (world) grand prix, I was hoping they would add a (classic) grand prix which is 12 players track laps only so thay everyone would get to play what they wanted.

Edit: to clarify, there is still a chance to get lap only tracks in random. I just haven't seen it happening but people are reporting it

2nd edit: ment to say 20ish not 8 to 12 people. Habit from MK8D made me count to 12 players only",2462,2025-06-26 09:26:41,NintendoSwitch,https://reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1lkqeab/nintendo_is_forcing_intermission_tracks_in_mario/,Activehannes

It has the benefit of still having the proper 3lap races, it makes the intermissions fun and with a benefit but not essential (especially since they tend to be a lot more luck heavy than regular courses), and it keeps the flavour. Best of both worlds imo.

The action taken by Nintendo?  Turns out they just changed it to “???”, but he can still use all the online features without any issues.

I’ll say that the reason of the ban isn’t related to the profile name.

Edit1: Thanks for all the comments I didn't except that many when I wrote my post at before midnight yesterday (central Europe). Fortunately, I don't have notifications otherwise I wouldn't be able to sleep. 😅

Personally, I have two Nintendo Switch OLED for Pokémon trades as a solo player. Now that I have a Switch 2, I want to sell one OLED but like many here I see the secondhand market full of ads with low prices.

Anyway I only transferred games with upgrades to my NS2 and some Pokémon saves. Since then I was wondering if I should transfer the rest of my games because they all run better on NS2 even without upgrades and only keep Pokémon saves on my NS which led to this post.

However, I see that a lot of you are complaining about the NS games on NS2 handheld mode because it is blurry due to upscaling. This only affects handheld mode right? Do you know if games like Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Pikimin 3 Deluxe, etc. that have updates with ""Several adjustments have been made to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2."" are prone to have the same issue?

I don't mind keeping some games on NS and others on NS2, but I would have liked to have a place that lets me know with one click whether a game has no problems in handheld mode or is likely to be blurry.

Figured I’d post this here as apparently this guy has been talked about a lot recently, especially in relation to all the Kremling/K. Rool rumors for DK Bananza, and apparently he has a very solid track record.

TLDR; Sakurai was burnt only after developing nothing but Smash since 2012, so in order to guarantee he’d be back for Smash 6, Nintendo allowed him to direct Kirby Air Riders. 

https://xcancel.com/kiwitalkz/status/1937965784325869950?s=46

Kiwi also makes note that this game likely hasn’t even entered pre-production, and that while Bandai Namco may be cooking something up, it’s very unlikely

reddit,mzwawna,Comment on: The humble Nintendo Direct:,"The easiest way to spot a fake Direct leak is the distribution of recognizable vs wtf games. Every actual Direct lineup is a ratio of one game series that is familiar or real-sounding to five games that were made by throwing darts at a spinning wheel of anime title components. A real Direct will be something like:

Mole-People Buildwar

Heaven's Hanging Tree Puzzle Blast 

Doctor Professor's Octoguild

Eye of the Scepter vs Avatar Extreme

Mario's Superjump Deluxe

The Rigid Horror Above

Dang Dang Dang Ballstrike 

And the more games you see on a list that make you go, ""I can tell what that's about"" or ""This property seems real, marketable, and comprehensible to a grandparent,"" the more likely it is that you're reading a fake.",258,2025-06-26 20:50:02,CuratedTumblr,https://reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1lkzfpn/the_humble_nintendo_direct/mzwawna/,withgreatpower

You can do this on the Nintendo Switch Online app by going to Profile > Settings > Feedback

reddit,mzigfqx,Comment on: How Slow is the Nintendo Switch 2 Display?,"Hopefully they give at least the ***option*** for some sort of screen overdrive mode in a firmware patch, obviously with the warning that it'll decrease battery life. Getting the pixel response even down below 25ms would make an enormous difference.

The biggest issue with this hardware, honestly, is the battery. I guess it's great that Nintendo kept everything to sub-10w, but they wouldn't have needed to be so aggressive with these power targets if they hadn't chosen such a tiny battery.

The Switch 2 is smaller than the battery in my phone, for example. For a 7.9 inch tablet device... that's not good. Had they gone with a battery 20-25% larger, they would've had an extra 2-2.5w to play around with for higher screen performance, higher handheld clocks and faster memory while keeping the battery life the exact same. \*sigh\*

Still having a lot of fun with the system, though, although admittedly I haven't played around with it too much in handheld yet.",79,2025-06-24 19:20:26,hardware,https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lj8dhz/how_slow_is_the_nintendo_switch_2_display/mzigfqx/,Not_Yet_Italian_1990

reddit,1lnnqlk,"Unpopular Opinion: The Switch 2 Is, In Terms of Release Titles, Nintendo’s Weakest Release to Date","And it’s why I frankly see no reason to rush out and get one, if I ever do. Honestly the novelty of my Switch rapidly wore off and it just became a vastly underpowered gaming tablet I could happen to dock into a TV or monitor very quickly…with its only real strong use case being a home for games I knew I wanted to play on the go and for Nintendo games. But as the Switch went on, Nintendo games became less a sell my point for me and watered down into…Mario Kart World for a release title. 

Seriously? THAT was their choice? Not Metroid Prime 4, which would have been FAR more able to showcase the technical improvements of the Switch 2 from the Switch? All we got was a game that could probably have been on the Switch 1 just fine and was held back for the 2, and a console that maybe can handle the older titles that struggled on the Switch 1 a little better. 

At present, I honestly would rather get a Steam Deck or Legion Go over a Switch 2. Am I saying I can see myself never getting a Switch 2? No. But I didn’t even get my Switch until about midway through its life, and then it rapidly wore off its relevancy and just became my portable gaming machine-with a small handful of titles. I have a PC library of over 500 games. Getting a Deck or Legion Go means I can just…play those games. Including Cyberpunk. The only real game I’d want on Switch 2 right now. 

I guess I just don’t see the hype. Am I missing something with the Switch 2 my Switch can’t do that’s a life changer?",329,2025-06-30 01:18:04,consoles,https://reddit.com/r/consoles/comments/1lnnqlk/unpopular_opinion_the_switch_2_is_in_terms_of/,TheEuphoricTribble

reddit,1lm2tc2,Brazilian consumer protection agency has formally notified Nintendo regarding new contractual terms deemed abusive,"According to the agency, these clauses allow the company to unilaterally cancel user accounts and permanently disable Switch 2 units for any “unauthorized use,” which Procon-SP argues violates Brazil’s Consumer Code. The policy grants Nintendo the power to render consoles “permanently unusable” without any clear criteria, which is seen as oppressive and legally problematic.

Another criticized provision forces consumers into mandatory individual arbitration, effectively barring them from taking legal action in Brazilian courts, including collective suits. Procon-SP views this as further infringement of consumer rights.

The company stated that it is reviewing Procon-SP's concerns and will provide an official response within 20 days.

Context:  
In the past, Sony banned a user's PS5 for similar reasons. The user filed a lawsuit, and Sony was forced to unban the console, as it goes against the Bazilian consumer law. The company can restrict access to online content but can't render the console unusable.

reddit,1lke78m,Help me find joy in gaming again? Mid 30-year-old who has lost the spark.,"I don’t know how often this happens to others or is talked about. If the love of video games diminishes over time. 

I remember unboxing my Gameboy and Nintendo in the 1990s. When Halo came out, I sold my PS2 so I could get an Xbox and play Halo. After I’d buy a new video game at the store, I’d read the booklet cover to cover on the way home. 

Through many hardships, like when I got leukemia at 25-years-old, video games were always an escape. Even in the worst moments, getting online would make the day a bit better. 

Some of my best memories include playing League of Legends with all my closest friends, jammed into one dorm room in college. Or trying to unlock armor on Halo Reach. Leveling up my Enhance Shaman during Lich King. And getting Taco Bell with the guys and waiting at GameStop for a midnight release. Building my first PC. Oh, LAN parties. I’d do anything for one more night of Halo 3 with the boys. 

Now, I can’t find a game (other than Balatro) that will hold my attention. I either bore instantly, do not have any joy, or lack any desire to play anything.

I have a wife and kid I love (another coming in August). My job is kinda demanding and I don’t have a ton of free time. 

Maybe this is growing up. I don’t know. 

TL;DR: I can’t tell why I’m losing my desire to play video games. If this is normal for millennials as they get older, or if it’s just something specific to me. 

It’s like a loss of identity in a way. Not that I need to have video games in my life, I just miss the joy they used to bring me. 

Anyone else go through this or find a way to relight the spark?

reddit,1lkohut,What game gave you the most of wonderment in your life?,"For me two answers come to mind The first Halo and Zelda:OOT

For Halo just landing on the ring world was awe inspiring. This was a level that didn't try to funnel you down a cooridor, but instead gave you an entire world to roam around in with you having to get to get to the middle of the structure in the middle to complete the level. 

I've told this story before but when I first got to it, ilI just started walking in more or less straight line, only to be killed cause I was sniped by a Grunt. I had played Mario 64 and I was a Nintendo 64 kid so 3D worlds were nothing new to me, but Halo made me rethink everything I knew about 3D. 

And Ocaraina: I actually had a bad first impression of the game, I mean not bad  but after months of hype,  I got it and played the first dungeon and was like ""Really, Nintendo ,  Really"" But the next day I beat the first boss and got out to Hyrule Fields and it was absolutely mind blowing. It was a hub worpd, but there was no currency to get to the next level, it was whatever you had on your person: If you could get there, you could go there. Of course we know now that those old Zelda games were EXTREMElY linear,  so it was really an illusion, but I didn't know that then, and I spent the entire weekend in Hyrule.

All 3 have faced lawsuits.

reddit,n0cv5kc,Comment on: Why do Xbox controllers seem to drift less than the competitors?,I *wish* I had your luck… Just got my 4th Xbox controller in about 5 years. All because of stick drift. I rarely drop my controllers. I don’t rage and throw them or slam them on my desk.. But I keep getting stick drift.,6,2025-06-29 09:57:08,gaming,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ln5vg8/why_do_xbox_controllers_seem_to_drift_less_than/n0cv5kc/,Koolaidsman43
reddit,n0cv965,Comment on: Why do Xbox controllers seem to drift less than the competitors?,I've had more issues with xbox X/S controllers than ps5 dualsenses by a wide margin; and don't even get me started on the xbox elite controllers. I think it's all just random and down to personal experience. (out of every device i've owned steam deck controllers started drifting the worst and soonest),5,2025-06-29 09:57:54,gaming,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ln5vg8/why_do_xbox_controllers_seem_to_drift_less_than/n0cv965/,surrealutensil
reddit,1liooo3,Any ideas for games on a 14 hour road trip?,"Me and my mom are taking my grandma Midwest as she’s moving in with my aunt and uncle. I’m sure I’ll be having talks and taking many photos with my grandma as she’s starting to lose it but I just wanted to be sure I have something to do with my hands. I only have a Switch and 3DS as a handheld so I’m thinking Nintendo but I’m so used to Pokemon games on my laptop it just doesn’t feel right to play and I have some Mario & Luigi titles but I’m not too interested in it tbh. I also have my laptop and am thinking about if I should take it with me as the van is pretty big and I do have space but it just seems too damn intrusive. Thoughts on games? I’m into Balatro, TBOI and BG3 atm so maybe a JRPG? ",0,2025-06-24 00:10:56,gaming,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1liooo3/any_ideas_for_games_on_a_14_hour_road_trip/,DarkIcedWolf
reddit,mzdpi2l,Comment on: Any ideas for games on a 14 hour road trip?,"Depends on what you'll do after the car ride. If your schedule will be busy you should probably only bring something for the car ride, or at most something you can play for five minutes and then set down for a while. The 3ds is luckily designed for that sort of game, so pretty much every game will serve you well. Just use the Sleep function.


If you'll have long periods of time where there's nothing to do, then bring your laptop, otherwise you probably won't use it at all ",5,2025-06-24 00:38:20,gaming,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1liooo3/any_ideas_for_games_on_a_14_hour_road_trip/mzdpi2l/,SuspiciouslyFluffy
