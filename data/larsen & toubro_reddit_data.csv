reddit,1lk39h5,(2025-06-24) Finance Flash Markets React to Feds Rate Decision,"## Market Movers and Shakers: A Snapshot of Indian Finance on June 24, 2025

June 24, 2025, saw a mixed bag of activity in the Indian financial markets, with key indices displaying both gains and losses across various sectors. The day’s performance was characterized by fluctuating share prices, with investors reacting to both domestic and global economic indicators. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the major market movements, highlighting the performance of key stocks and industry trends.

**Banking and Finance Sector:**

The banking sector exhibited a mixed performance. **HDFC Bank**, a large-cap entity, showed positive momentum with a 0.74% gain for the day, closing at ₹1961.7. The stock had a daily low of ₹1955.25 and a high of ₹1978.85, showcasing intraday volatility. Its 52-week range lay between ₹1588.5 and ₹1996.3. Similarly, **State Bank of India (SBI)** experienced a modest increase, up 0.78% to ₹796.25.  **ICICI Bank** showed a marginal increase of 0.24% closing at ₹1423. However, monthly performance for all three banks remains moderate to positive at 1.15%, 0.25%, and -2.57% respectively. This suggests that while investors were cautiously optimistic during the day, the broader trend for the past month has been more subdued in the banking space. Technical analysis suggests the daily pivot level for HDFC Bank at 1967.07, SBI at 801.6, and ICICI at 1429.67.

Further underlining the news in the financial landscape, the **State Bank of India (SBI)** opened applications for 541 Probationary Officer (PO) positions, a significant announcement that could influence the future of banking sector employees. The application window, opened on June 24th, will remain open until July 14th. Eligibility requirements include graduation from a recognized university, with candidates born between April 2, 1995, and April 1, 2004, being eligible to apply. The SBI PO recruitment is a key indicator of the job market health and investor sentiment in the banking sector.

**Energy and Infrastructure:**

The energy and infrastructure sectors presented a more varied picture. **Oil And Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)**, despite operating in the volatile oil drilling and exploration sector, experienced a negative day with a -2.83% daily return, closing at ₹244. The stock traded between ₹243.55 and ₹247.95 during the day and its 52-week range lay between ₹205 and ₹344.6. This indicated a potentially bearish sentiment towards the sector, although the performance over the past three months remained slightly positive (0.18%).  The daily pivot level for ONGC was set at 246.45. Further data showed that ONGC's closing price later updated to ₹243.75, with a -2.9% day return. **NTPC**, in the power sector, also experienced a downward trend, closing at ₹329.75 with a -1.15% daily return. Monthly and quarterly trends for NTPC show significantly negative performance (-3.95% and -10.21%).

The infrastructure sector saw varied performance. **Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone** demonstrated strong growth with a 2.9% increase, closing at ₹1392.25. The stock had a high of ₹1418.85 and a low of ₹1386.95. This bullish trend over the past three months, which saw a 16.07% return, demonstrates a strong positive outlook. **Larsen & Toubro**, another prominent player in the construction and engineering sector, showed a modest gain of 0.79%, closing at ₹3611.8, with a daily high of ₹3683.4. These fluctuations are not surprising given the sector’s sensitivity to macroeconomic factors and government spending. The daily pivot level for Adani Ports was 1408.47 and for Larsen & Toubro it was 3647.7.

**IT, Metals, and Consumer Goods:**

The IT sector showed mixed results. **Wipro** experienced a 0.97% increase, closing at ₹265.45. While the performance over the past month was positive, its three-month return was negative, demonstrating the ongoing volatile mood in the industry. **Infosys** registered a slight decline of -0.09%, closing at ₹1581.75.  Analysts noted that the daily pivot level for Wipro was at 266.4, with resistance levels at 267.2, 268.15, and 268.95.

June 24, 2025, presented a mixed bag of economic news, with market movements heavily influenced by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Alongside these broader developments, individual stock performances across various sectors on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) provided a snapshot of investor sentiment and sector-specific trends. Furthermore, an inspiring story of entrepreneurial growth highlighted the potential for rapid career advancement.

**Geopolitical Tensions and Oil Price Reaction**

The most significant headline of the day centered on the interplay between escalating geopolitical tensions and the oil market. Following American airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with missile strikes, targeting a US military base in Qatar. Contrary to initial expectations, however, oil prices *declined* in response. Market analysts interpreted this seemingly counterintuitive outcome as a sign that Iran's actions, though escalatory in nature, were strategically limited. The missile strikes were viewed as a symbolic response, not a prelude to actions that would disrupt oil shipments or block the critical Strait of Hormuz, a key chokepoint for global oil trade. This de-escalatory tone in Iran's response, as perceived by oil traders, led to the price decrease, underscoring the sensitivity of the market to any threat of supply chain disruptions.

**Stock Market Performance: A Sector-by-Sector Analysis**

The majority of the provided news summaries centered on the share prices of prominent Largecap companies listed on the BSE. The overall picture revealed a day of mixed performance, with varying degrees of gains and losses across different sectors. Key observations include:

Investigators found that workers had not installed additional lateral bracing at the centre of the girders, putting excessive pressure on the fastening buckles meant to hold them in place.

reddit,1lijkov,A list of 100% free mental health apps. No in-app purchases or subscriptions.,"I know im not the only line cook here who struggles with mental health, but also cant go to therapy. 
Here are a handful of high-quality, 100% free apps—no subscriptions, no paywalls, no in-app purchases—created by universities, government agencies, or open-source teams.  Most work fully offline and can be great companions alongside whatever support you can access.
I created this list for myself and thought, this definitely needs to be shared. So come on, let get out of this cooler and get control of our health 😎 

• PTSD Coach (iOS & Android)  
  Created by the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, it offers self-assessment tools, symptom trackers, guided exercises (breathing, grounding, muscle relaxation), and a library of educational resources.  

• Mindfulness Coach (iOS & Android)  
  Also from the VA, this walks you through a full mindfulness training program, from basic breathing exercises to body scans and loving-kindness meditations.  All content is free and available offline.  

• CBT-i Coach (iOS & Android)  
  If sleepless nights are your biggest stressor, CBT-i Coach delivers core cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: sleep logs, stimulus-control tools, sleep hygiene tips, and progress charts—no signup required.  

• Self-help for Anxiety Management (SAM) (Android only)  
  Developed by the University of the West of England, SAM lets you build your own toolkit of anxiety-busting exercises: mindfulness audios, guided self-help, private journals and peer forums.  

• IntelliCare Suite (iOS & Android)  
  A collection of 12 mini-apps from Northwestern University, each focusing on one skill (mood tracking, worry management, positivity, action-planning).  You choose which ones you want; none ever charge you.  

• What’s Up? (iOS & Android)  
  A tightly focused CBT and ACT toolkit: thought-logs, habit trackers, a “positive and negative habit” module, grounding exercises, and quick-relief tools.  Everything is free forever[^5^].  

• MoodTools (Android) / MoodTools Depression Aid (iOS)  
  Designed to help with depression, it offers a thought diary, an “activity scheduling” planner, informational videos on CBT, and a suicide safety plan feature.  

• DBT Self-Help (iOS & Android)  
  Based on Dialectical Behavior Therapy, this free app (by Sarah Helweg-Larsen) organizes core DBT skills—mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness—in an easy-to-use menu.  

• Smiling Mind (iOS & Android)  
  An Australian non-profit’s multi-age mindfulness program.  You pick your “mindfulness journey” (7–17, adult, workplace) and access dozens of guided practices at no cost.  

• eMoods (iOS & Android)  
  A mood-tracking app built for people with bipolar disorder.  You log highs, lows, meds, sleep, and the app generates shareable weekly/monthly reports you can bring to your doctor.  

• My3 (iOS & Android)  
  A safety-planning tool for suicidal thoughts: you create a personalized crisis plan, list contacts who can help, and map out your warning signs.  

Bonus peer-support/chat option (free, no subscription):  
• BuddyHelp (Web/mobile-friendly chat)  
  Connects you anonymously with trained volunteer listeners on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Telegram—no app fees, no subscription, just chat when you need to vent.  

—  
These apps won’t replace professional treatment when that’s needed, but they give you real skills, trackers, guided exercises, and crisis-planning tools without costing you a cent. If one style doesn’t click, try another—everyone’s mind works differently, and the perfect fit is out there.",178,2025-06-23 20:58:15,KitchenConfidential,https://reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1lijkov/a_list_of_100_free_mental_health_apps_no_inapp/,LostintheAlone

On the side I know web dev and am 1900 on leetcode and will focus on cse till the end of masters at least for my self study.
I have a choice between robotics masters in iit and robotics msc in public universities abroad.
End goal: PhD in something similar then corporate.probably defense sectors or something like that.

I want to work for some time after my masters. My company had shitty work culture and I want to give the other side a shot. I would like to have the equivalent of 3lpm during this time(say living cost is 1lakh). I have issues with groupism and work place politics. I can deal with it but I think it hampers the output employees put out a lot.

I also find myself at odds with the things people prioritize. Like no one I know goes regularly to a gym but ever since college that has been a necessity,just for mental stability.same goes for coffee and stuff like that which i think costs insanely too much because in india only rich westernized people do it so it's all overpriced as hell.

Money is not much an issue but the lesser the load on parents the better, so part time job is a must. I already have the first years block settled.

So in terms of all these points, is Germany really a better option, like what are the nitty gritties that may change that?

(Placement after masters at iith could be anywhere between 15-40 lpa CTC(so the in hand could just be 1 lpm or even less). But Germany has a 42% tax cut on 60k+ salaries which would probably bring the end salary down 15-40 lpa only, even if the companies there lie less about CTCs)

On the other hand, here even though groceries and all are cheaper i don't seem to be able to breakeven properly because my ""recreational"" activities are unaffordable.

reddit,1ljho2d,Trying to Collect Marvel 616 Comics — Looking for Suggestions on My Omnibus List,"Hey everyone!

I’m diving into collecting Marvel comics, focusing on the main 616 timeline. I’m especially interested in reading a lot of Spider-Man stories and want to eventually cover the big events like *Secret Wars*, *Infinity Gauntlet*, *Infinity War*, and *Infinity Crusade*.

I’ve heard the best way to get into Marvel is to start with your favorite heroes — and mine are Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor, Silver Surfer, Doctor Strange, and Hulk. I also love team books like *Fantastic Four*, *X-Men*, and *The Avengers*.

So, I’ve started putting together a list of omnibus collections to get, and I wanted to share it here for feedback, corrections, or any suggestions you might have to improve it.

Here’s what I have so far:

**Spider-Man:**

* Amazing Spider-Man Omnibus Vol. 1-2
* Untold Tales of Spider-Man Omnibus
* Amazing Spider-Man Omnibus Vol. 3-4
* Spider-Man by Roger Stern Omnibus
* Amazing Spider-Man Omnibus Vol. 5
* Spider-Man by David Michelinie & Todd McFarlane Omnibus
* Spider-Man vs. Venom Omnibus 
* Spider-Man by Todd McFarlane Omnibus 
* Spider-Man by David Michelinie & Erik Larsen Omnibus

**Iron Man:**

* Iron Man Omnibus Vol. 1-3
* Michelinie and Layton Vol. 1
* Demon in a Bottle
* Len Kaminski Omnibus
* Joe Quesada Omnibus
* Extremis
* Matt Fraction Omnibus Vol. 1-2

* Fantastic Four by John Byrne Omnibus Vol. 1-2
* Fantastic Four by Mark Waid and Mike Wieringo Omnibus

**The Avengers:**

* Avengers Omnibus Vol. 1-6

reddit,1lhpjgl,"Unhealthy breakfast: How the National Prayer Breakfast, a relic from the 1950s era of civil religion, evolved into a florid display of Christian Nationalism [2024]","Organizers described the reformatted National Prayer Breakfast as a “reset” when it returned to Washington, D.C., as an in-person gathering in 2023 after years of controversy and the pandemic forced a proverbial come-to-Jesus moment over the event’s future. 

But now, after two years of the annual event being organized by the newly formed National Prayer Breakfast Foundation, critics are pointing to growing church-state separation problems while questioning the degree to which “The Family” — the secretive, controversial Christian Nationalist organization that ran the breakfast for decades —remains involved.


To those watching on television, this year’s National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 1 probably didn’t look much different from past events. As usual, an intentionally bipartisan group of members of Congress offered Christian prayers and read from the Bible. There was Christian music sung by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. Senate Chaplain Barry Black’s keynote speech was saturated with Bible references; House Chaplain Margaret Grun Kibben offered a closing prayer “in the name of Jesus.” President Joe Biden offered some remarks, continuing the unbroken, 71-year tradition of every sitting president since Dwight D. Eisenhower attending the event.


Americans United’s primary concerns about the National Prayer Breakfast — that government is organizing a worship service, one that favors a single religion — were encapsulated in the opening remarks from U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann (R-Kan.), who co-chaired this year’s event with U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan (D-Ind.). “We gather in historic Statuary Hall this morning in the spirit of Jesus to pray for the president, for one another and for the country,” Mann said.


For years the National Prayer Breakfast was held in a Washington, D.C., hotel. Last year it was moved to the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. This year it occurred in the U.S. Capitol itself — Statuary Hall, a symbolic space that once was the location of presidential inaugurations and more recently has been used as a site to pay tribute to eminent citizens upon their death; recent honorees lying in state there included Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and U.S. Reps. Don Young (R-Alaska) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).


“It is still deeply problematic that members of Congress are directly involved in hosting a religious event at the seat of our federal government,” Americans United President and CEO Rachel Laser remarked. “Our public officials should not be organizing and promoting religious worship services in government buildings because it divides the country on religious lines, favoring a select few and making everyone else feel unwelcome.”


Journalist Jonathan Larsen, who has reported extensively on the National Prayer Breakfast and The Family for the progressive news site The Young Turks and now for his own Substack newsletters, noted the House controls the use of Statuary Hall, which means House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had to approve moving the breakfast into the U.S. Capitol. Some organizers had requested an even more prominent location: Last November, Mann and Mrvan co-sponsored a bill that would have authorized the use of the Capitol Rotunda for the breakfast. The bill never moved out of committee and did not pass.


All of the speakers at this year’s National Prayer Breakfast were Christian. Occasionally the program has included non-Christians — U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and U.S. Rep. David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), who are Jewish, each had a brief speaking role once in the past five years. But the event is always overwhelmingly Christian.


“’All faiths’ were supposedly welcome, but who were they kidding?” asked U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and AU Vice President of Strategic Communications Andrew L. Seidel in a joint column published by the Daily Beast. “Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and other non-Christians were implicitly disinvited by ‘gathering in the spirit of Jesus and calling on the Lord in prayer,’ at a program indistinguishable from a Christian church service.


“’Nones’ like us — people who identify as atheists, Humanists, agnostics, or nothing in particular — were categorically excluded,” Huffman and Seidel wrote. “The Prayer Breakfast’s exalting of Christian privilege divides America along religious lines and flouts the equality our Constitution enshrines.”


While the program of the “official” National Prayer Breakfast looks largely unchanged on television, there is at least one significant difference for those attending in person: the crowd is substantially smaller. Attendance is now supposed to be limited to members of Congress and other government officials and their “plus-ones” — one guest each who must be either a spouse, family member or constituent. Organizers have estimated 200-300 people attended the last two breakfasts.


That’s a far cry from the crowd of several thousand that typically attended the multi-day series of National Prayer Breakfast events hosted by The Family, also known as the International Foundation and the Fellowship Foundation. The guest list had exploded beyond members of Congress to include a sizable contingent of representatives from foreign governments and the Family’s international affiliates, plus faith leaders, lobbyists and various hangers-on. It was as much a networking event as a prayer service, one that gave attendees access to U.S. politicians and powerbrokers.


The less savory side of the breakfast’s networking came to a head in 2018 when it was revealed that a Russian spy indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice had attended the prayer breakfast twice, allegedly seeking to set up a back channel for communications between Russian and U.S. officials. Maria Butina, a Russian gun rights activist and businesswoman, ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy and was sentenced to 18 months in a U.S. federal prison. She admitted to being a secret agent for the Kremlin while covertly gathering intelligence on the National Rifle Association and other groups at the direction of a former Russian lawmaker.


U.S. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a longtime co-host of the prayer breakfast, acknowledged to the Associated Press (AP) in 2023 that the Family-run event was becoming challenging for members of Congress to support.


“Some questions had been raised about our ability as members of Congress to say that we knew exactly how it was being organized, who was being invited, how it was being funded. Many of us who’d been in leadership roles really couldn’t answer those questions,” Coons said.


A spokeswoman for U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told the AP Kaine had stopped attending the event in 2016 because it “had become an entertainment and lobbying extravaganza rather than an opportunity for spiritual reflection.”


The embarrassment over a Russian spy rubbing elbows with U.S. officials and faith leaders at the National Prayer Breakfast was compounded in 2019 when Netflix released the documentary series “The Family” — a multi-part exposé of The Family’s inner workings, Christian Nationalist agenda and ties to foreign governments. The series, which was based on two books written by award-winning literary journalist and former AU Trustee Jeff Sharlet, included substantial coverage of the prayer breakfast.


And while organizers have long attempted to bill the event as a bipartisan testament to the supposed ability of prayer to unite people, that framing fell flat during the four years that President Donald Trump addressed the crowd. At his first prayer breakfast appearance in 2017, Trump encouraged attendees to pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, because his ratings on reality TV show “The Apprentice” weren’t as good as when Trump starred on the show. Trump also issued the false promise to “get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment” to enable evangelical pastors to endorse him.


During his final year in office, Trump arrived on the prayer breakfast stage holding a copy of USA Today over his head to display the bold, front-page headline “ACQUITTED” — celebrating the Senate’s refusal the day before to impeach him. After keynote speaker Arthur Brooks, a Harvard University professor, urged the crowd to love their enemies and leave contempt out of disagreements, Trump stood at the podium and praised the Republicans who had acquitted him and sneered at then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — sitting just a few seats from him on the dais — by casting doubt on her previous comments that she prayed for him.


Several faith leaders took offense at Trump’s remarks and his use of the prayer breakfast stage to attack political opponents.


“I find it deeply problematic that the president uses the National Prayer Breakfast to lambaste the faith of his opponents,” Noah Farkas, a Conservative Jewish rabbi from California, told AP. “He forgets the history of faith in this country, and disrespects others who speak from their sense of faithful conscience.”


“A bipartisan prayer breakfast is the last place one would expect to find political attacks on opponents,” said the Rev. Tom Lambrecht, general manager of the conservative United Methodist magazine Good News.


When the COVID-19 pandemic forced the event to go virtual in 2021, prayer breakfast supporters decided it was due for an overhaul. The National Prayer Breakfast Foundation was formed with the sole purpose of hosting the annual event; former U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) was named as the first board chair (he’s since been replaced by former U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota).


“Increasingly, the desire was to return the annual event to its origins as a more intimate gathering between the Congress, the President, and those in his administration,” Pryor announced in early 2023. “As with many other things in our country, the COVID years allowed the Members to hit the reset button and organize a working group to fulfil this longtime vision.”


But skeptics like journalist Larsen have questioned just how involved The Family still may be with the National Prayer Breakfast.


Take U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.), for example. He was a co-chair of the 2023 National Prayer Breakfast. Months later, in October, The Family paid for his trip to Uganda’s National Prayer Breakfast, according to Larsen. While there, Walberg delivered a keynote address in which he urged Ugandans to “stand firm” in support of the anti-LGBTQ+ bill that imposes the death penalty on “serial offenders” of “aggravated homosexuality.”


Even before the first revamped prayer breakfast was held in 2023, Larsen had noted that many members of the new National Prayer Breakfast Foundation board had deep ties to The Family or past prayer breakfasts. They included Caroline Aderholt, a trustee for the Christian Nationalist organization Concerned Women for America and wife of longtime Family insider U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.); U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.); Max Finberg, a former aide to longtime Family insider former U.S. Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio); Grace Nelson, wife of NASA Administrator and former U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.); and Stan Holmes, president and CEO of the nonprofit Core Fellowship Foundation.


U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), a member of the Congressional Freethought Caucus, earlier this year sent a letter to The Family, demanding to know the degree to which it’s involved in the official National Prayer Breakfast, as well as the nature and extent of its operations around the world. He voiced particular concern about the organization’s connections to anti-LGBTQ+ legislation abroad.


While the new prayer breakfast was happening on Capitol Hill last year, The Family reportedly invited about 1,400 people for a two-day “National Prayer Breakfast Gathering” at the Washington Hilton hotel; a spokesman said about a third of invitees were international guests. The program for the “official” breakfast was live-streamed at The Family’s event, which Biden acknowledged in his remarks: “I understand we got a bunch of folks at a hotel not far from here. … They apparently are watching this. Welcome. … I’m grateful you’re able to join us in prayer this morning and lift up one another and our nation.”


It was unclear whether The Family hosted a prayer breakfast event this year; the organization never has released much information about its events, and there were no media reports on a Family-sponsored breakfast in 2024.


What has received a fair amount of news coverage is the similarly named National Gathering for Prayer and Repentance that occurred the day before the National Prayer Breakfast this year and last. Hosted by the Museum of the Bible just off the National Mall in Washington, D.C., the event reportedly was co-founded by House Speaker Mike Johnson.


“The gathering is staged as a far-right counterweight to the National Prayer Breakfast,” Rolling Stone magazine reported. It described the National Gathering for Prayer and Repentance as a stark contrast to the official breakfast by featuring “extremist calls for Christians to stand in opposition to sinful American culture — in particular the rise of LGBTQ freedoms, the environmental movement, and the practice of abortion. The kind of repentance sought by the speakers was often less for personal failings than for the failure of Christians to exert power and control over those who don’t obey their theology.”


Rolling Stone reported the event “was chock-a-block with Christian nationalist pastors and featured a clarion call for spiritual warfare, with members of Congress beseeching fellow Christians to ‘tie the hands of Satan’ and to ‘bind the demonic forces’ that are supposedly possessing America.”


In addition to Johnson, speakers included event co-founders Tony Perkins, head of the Christian Nationalist group Family Research Council, and Jim Garlow, described as an “apostle” in the Christian Nationalist New Apostolic Reformation movement, which calls on Christians to take “dominion” over government and society to bring about the biblical end times.


There may have been less talk of Christians taking over government at the official National Prayer Breakfast, but Americans United still thinks it’s an anachronism that has no place in a country with church-state separation.


“America’s promise of church-state separation and religious freedom means that our government cannot favor one faith over others or religion over nonreligion,” AU’s Laser said. “The National Prayer Breakfast, which was created during a wave of Christian Nationalism in the 1950s, has flouted that promise.”


On AU’s “Wall of Separation” blog, AU Senior Advisor and Church & State editor Rob Boston summed it up: “It’s time to consign the National Prayer Breakfast to the dustbin of history.”

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Norwegian Eliteserien Showdown: Rosenborg vs. Viking FK**  
*The Drama of Missing Stars and the Perils of Overconfidence*

**The Setup**  
Rosenborg, the storied ""Trondheim Giants,"" host Viking FK at a sold-out Lerkendal Stadion. On paper, this is a clash of titans: Rosenborg (3rd, 21 points) vs. Viking (1st, 29 points). But let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: Rosenborg’s roster looks like a post-apocalyptic clearance bin. Their top scorer, **Marius Broholm**, was shipped to Lille, and **Sverre Nypan** is likely to follow. Add in injuries to Tomas Nemcik, Luka Racic, and Noah Sahsah, and Rosenborg’s attack resembles a broken toaster—full of potential, but currently sparking out.

Viking, meanwhile, is the league’s version of a well-oiled espresso machine: consistent, caffeinated, and ready to brew a title. They’ve won 8 of their last 10 matches and have the third-highest xG (expected goals) in the league. But can they capitalize on Rosenborg’s chaos?

---

**The Numbers Game**

* **Rosenborg’s Implied Probability (from odds):**
   * **1.95 (FanDuel/Bovada)** → 51.28% chance to win.
   * **Adjusted for vigorish:** \~45.4% (after dividing by total implied probability of 112.95%).
* **Viking’s Implied Probability:**
   * **2.95 (BetRivers)** → 33.89% → **\~30% adjusted**.
* **Draw:** 3.6 → 27.78% → **\~24.6% adjusted**.

**Underdog Win Rate Context:**  
Soccer’s underdogs (non-favorites) win **41%** of the time. Viking is the underdog here, with a **30% implied chance** vs. 41% historical rate. That’s a **11% edge** in their favor.

---

**Key Injuries & Player Updates**

* **Rosenborg’s Absences:**
   * **Marius Broholm** (15 goals this season) is gone.
   * **Sverre Nypan** (12 assists) is likely to be sold.
   * **Tomas Nemcik** (defensive anchor) and **Luka Racic** (midfielder) are injured.
   * **Noah Sahsah** (goalkeeper) is out.
   * Captain **Ole Selnæs** is optimistic, but optimism doesn’t score goals.
* **Viking’s Edge:**
   * Full-strength squad.
   * **Top scorer Erik Larsen** (18 goals) is in form, with 5 goals in his last 4 games.

---

**The Witty Take**  
Rosenborg’s management has turned their squad into a Norwegian version of *The Office*—full of potential but cursed by poor decisions. Selling Broholm and Nypan mid-season is like burning your starting five before a playoff game. Meanwhile, Viking is the league’s version of a vegan who’s never tasted meat but somehow still wins the steak-off.

---

**Odds Expected Value (EV) Calculation**

* **Viking’s EV:**
   * **Underdog win rate (41%) vs. implied 30%** → **11% edge**.
   * **EV = (0.41 \* 2.95) - (0.59 \* 1) = 1.2095 - 0.59 = +0.6195**.
   * **Per $100 bet:** $61.95 profit.
* **Rosenborg’s EV:**
   * **Implied 45.4% vs. historical 55% (favorites win \~55% in soccer)** → **10% edge**.
   * **EV = (0.454 \* 1.95) - (0.546 \* 1) = 0.885 - 0.546 = +0.339**.
   * **Per $100 bet:** $33.90 profit.

---

**The Verdict**  
**Best Bet: Viking FK (+295 to +335) at BetRivers**

* **Why?** The EV is higher for Viking (61.95% vs. 33.90%), and their 30% implied win rate is **11% below** soccer’s 41% underdog rate. Rosenborg’s injuries and sales have crippled their title defense.

**Spread Play: Viking +0.5 (-115)**

* If you want to maximize value, take Viking to cover the -0.5 spread. Their 3-1-1 record against top-5 teams this season suggests they can at least stay competitive.

**Avoid the Draw (4.0+ odds):**

* With both teams playing for points and Rosenborg’s attack in disarray, a 24.6% chance for a draw feels inflated.

---

**Final Thought**  
Rosenborg’s captain says they’re coming for three points. But with their squad resembling a cast of *Napoleon Dynamite*, maybe they should just settle for one. Viking’s the pick, unless you enjoy watching teams with no business winning somehow pull off the impossible. (Spoiler: That’s 41% of the time in soccer.)

**Bet Viking FK** — because even a broken toaster can shock you with a spark. 🔥

reddit,1lf5s2f,His Ex-wife Is An Heiress – Full Novel Summary & Spoilers Inside,"# Chapter 1 Her Shattering Dreams.

'There was nothing more ironic than sitting alone at a wide marble table facing a pile of leftovers, while your husband was having fun with his lover on the day of your 6th wedding anniversary.'

Amara's heart was weeping. Amara felt her heart cold as the food before her at this moment. She once believed her husband would at least remember his duty on this special day, but it shattered as she received the photos from her private investigator.

He and his mistress were having a candle dinner beside the floor-to-ceiling window. Having the woman in his arms, he had a doting smile on his face.

During the entire 6 years of their marriage, Tobias had never for once shown her that soft smile of his. He always treated her with a cold and serious expression. I knew our marriage had not begun with love, but a contract. However, from the first moment I met him as a teenager, he took my heart.

Tobias William Larsen, a household name in this country. In addition to his excellent look, his intelligent brain made him even more charming. Countless women dreamed of a sweet romance with the perfect heir of Labyrinth yet he married young. And what fascinated the women even more was that he was also a devoted husband. Since his marriage to that mysterious wife, he never had a single scandal. Which woman wouldn't want such a man?

But only Amara knew what the truth was. Their marriage was just an adornment to his good name. He needed a stable marriage to build a trustful image to the outside, however, when they were alone together, he wouldn't bother to give her one more glance. She never owned his caring, talk less his love. Tobias' love was only left for that woman.

The woman in the photo and his first love, Celestine.

And that's what broke Amara. No matter how much she had sacrificed for him, he could feel no love for her. Yet all it took was a smile or a tear from Celestine and he would return to her, regardless of how deeply she had hurt him six years ago.

Zooming the photo, Amara tried to search for even a hint of guilt on his face but failed again. Amara knew their marriage would face challenges since Gustavo, Tobias' grandfather, passed away, but she didn't expect it to be so soon. Tobias couldn't wait to get his first love back, even if it would be a blow to his hard-earned reputation.

\[How does it feel to be left alone on your wedding anniversary?\]

Suddenly, she received an unfamiliar text message on her cell phone, and from the long-lost and mean tone, Amara didn't have to think to recognize it was from Celestine.

\[You thought you had won after your pathetic tricks forcing Tobias to leave me, now the old man has gone and no one will be on your side! Let's wait and see, Amara. Your good days are at an end!\]

\[Cherish your last moment as Mrs. Larsen, for it will soon belong to me!\]

Gritting her teeth, Amara could imagine what a smug expression over on Celestine's face there. How could that b\*tch twist the truth so shamelessly? She never forced Tobias to break up with Celestine and it was Celestine herself who abandoned Tobias for a large amount of fortune. She failed Gustavo's test yet blamed all this on her now! How dare her?

Amara still remembered what Gustavo told her on his deathbed. The old man wanted her to guard his grandson, to hold on to this marriage. Amara didn't know what Gustavo had seen on her but until the last moment, he still believed that Amara was the only one who could bring Tobias happiness. It was hard for Amara to say no to this kind old man. Gustavo was only the one who treated Amara right in the Larsen family and if he hadn't provided her with a place to stay, Amara would hardly have survived to the day she reunited with her family.

Pulling her messy mind back, Amara sent her husband a text. And she was sure Tobias would come home instantly.

Within half an hour, her bedroom door was pushed open vigorously by Tobias and what she met was his angry face. Tobias walked over to her and pushed her down on the bed as his hand stripped her nightgown.

""Tobias!"" She screamed, trying to stop him. She wasn't asking him back to have sex, she called him back just because she wanted a talk. If they were destined to fail Gustavo, she hoped their marriage would end on a decent note.

The man above her, however, didn't bother to respond and instead, he began to nibble on her ear, sucking and biting the sensitive flesh until she was writhing beneath him.

""A-ah, Tobias,"" she called, her voice coming out breathy as she tried to push him off.

He growled, clearly displeased by her attempts, and without hesitation, he pinned her arms above her head, holding her wrists with one hand while the other trailed down her body, pausing only to pinch and play with her sensitive nipples before he moved it further down until he was rubbing the fabric of her underwear.

""Ah,"" Amara moaned, unable to stop herself.

The moment Tobias's finger brushed her sensitive clitoris, she felt her entire body go stiff. But of course, Tobias didn't care as he continued to tease her, stroking her sensitive clit until her underwear was soaked and her thighs were quivering.

""T-Tobias,"" she mewled, her voice filled with the pleasure that was quickly building up inside her, and soon, under the guidance of Tobias's skillful hands, Amara reached the height of her ecstasy.

Panting heavily, Amara barely had enough time to process all that had happened when she felt Tobias's hard length enter her, stretching her to accommodate his large girth.

""Ah,"" she moaned, her eyes fluttering shut.

Tobias groaned, a deep throaty sound that had her insides clenching and her core throbbing. He buried his head in the crook of her neck, nibbling and sucking the sensitive skin as he pulled his length almost all the way out, before slamming back inside her.

Amara moaned and writhed, her hands moving up to grab his hair. She tugged on the soft brown strands, her fingers curling and uncurling.

The room was filled with the sound of skin slapping against skin, Amara's moans, and the bed creaking beneath their weight.

And while all this happened, Amara felt her feelings clash. Earlier, she was hurt, irritated, and angered by all of Tobias's actions, but now, with his warm body covering hers and his large girth buried deep within her, stretching her, making her feel all kinds of pleasure, she couldn't find the will to stay angry or feel hurt.

Rather, she felt loved.

It was foolish, but she wanted to believe that maybe, just maybe, Tobias didn't come home because of the text message she had sent, but because it was their anniversary and he wanted to make her feel loved and wanted.

With that thought in mind, she wrapped her legs around his waist, pulling him closer and deeper inside her.

Tobias groaned, his hips speeding up.

Amara cried out, her walls tightening around his length, drawing him in deeper.

""To-Tobias, I'm-,"" Amara stammered, her breath hitching in her throat as she felt her orgasm approach.

""Go ahead, cum."" Tobias growled, his voice low and husky.

And then he did something he hadn't done in a long time, he leaned down and captured her lips in a kiss, inflating whatever hope she had for their marriage.

It didn't take long before her entire body tensed, her eyes squeezed shut, her nails dug into his skin, and she reached her climax.

Tobias didn't stop.

He kept thrusting, his movements becoming more and more frantic until his own release followed shortly.

Spent, he pulled out of her and rolled over, lying on the space beside her.

For a moment, the only thing Amara could hear was their combined panting and the sound of their heartbeats. Yet, his very next words felt like a sharp knife stabled to her heart.

""We have no need to keep up this shame of a marriage anymore, Amara. Let's divorce.""

# Chapter 2 Threatened To Divorce.

""What?"" Amara finally managed to ask, after a long silence between them. She hoped what she heard before was only some trick played on her by her mind.

""You heard me. Now that Grandfather is no longer here I think it's time we get a divorce."" Tobias answered without missing a beat. ""And don't forget, you brought it up first.""

Tears streamed down her face and Amara felt hard to breathe. Yes, she mentioned divorce and Grandfather's will in that text message. If they end up divorcing, Amara could get half of his property.

But actually, the property was never what Amara wanted. She even planned to return it to him if one day Tobias did find someone worth spending his life with. She just couldn't sit and watch Gustavo's legacy being tainted by someone like Celestine. So she wanted Tobias back and to talk with him.

She did choose some words to irritate Tobias on purpose and she had been prepared to take on his wrath. But as soon as he came back, he rode her. He melted her with his dominance. He was the one who wove her with the illusion that there was still hope for their shattering marriage...

""You…want a divorce?"" Her voice choked. ""Then why did you make love with me just now?""

Her voice was full of brokenness as she buried her head in the sheets. The scent of each other still lingered on them, and her thighs still trembling slightly from his passionate thrust before. They were making love like a sweet couple a while ago yet the next second, such cruel words spewed from his lips.

""It's only sex."" His tone was heartless, completely oblivious to her pain. ""Besides, isn't that what you wanted? You did enjoy it but I did that only to tell you the truth, even if my pen\*s gets used to your vag\*na for the past six years, it doesn't mean I'm in love with you.""

His words were like a sharp knife stabbing into her heart. Her face turned pale and her eyes wet. Yes, their sex life was always wonderful and that was also what made her stick with the marriage for so many years. Amara naively assumed that he had at least a bit of feelings for her, or his desire wouldn't be aroused so easily.

She once thought it was love. Yet wrong. So wrong.

He wanted her only for his needs. She was just a sex doll for him. When his true love came back, she could only be abandoned.

""Come on, Amara, don't act like you're an innocent dove. You know how our marriage came! You saved my grandfather and you used this to threaten him. That's why he forced me to marry you. That's the whole truth about our marriage!""

""No, Tobias! It's not like that!"" Amara shook her head desperately. ""I didn't threaten grandfather. I married you just because I love you.""

""Enough! Stop bothering me!"" Tobias threw on his trousers and a white shirt, clearly preparing to leave. ""I'll have the divorce documents sent to you as soon as possible, so quietly sign them without kicking up a fuss.""

Amara couldn't believe the words she was hearing. Her eyes fluttered furiously, desperately trying to hold back tears that had gathered in the bottom of her eyes. The scene before Gustavo's death came to her mind.

The dying old man put Tobias' and her hands together kindly telling them to love each other and make a happy life.

""Amara, my kid, I know you have suffered a lot, but please, please take good care of Tobias for me. I know only you can make it.""

His last words lingered in her ears, fueling her resolve to have a last try. However, Tobias didn't give her the chance. He flung a black card in her face as he wore his tie without looking back.

""Take half of my family property is beyond. Here's 50 million pounds, enough to last you several lifetimes. Take the money and sign the divorce paper obediently, or don't blame me for being rude.""

With this, he turned and walked out the door. The finality in his stance and movement snuffed out whatever faith Amara left in her.

Silently, she sat on the bed, tears streaming down her face. How did she end up like this?

If it hadn't been for the car accident, Amara never thought her life would have crossed paths with Tobias.

By that chance, she saved the aged Gustavo. To thank her, Gustavo wanted to let his grandson marry her and she never expected his grandson to turn out to be Tobias, her obsession since her teenage. At that moment, she believed she was his destined bride.

However, she didn't expect that Tobias already had his first love. Amara had asked Gustavo to withdraw his decision, but the old man desperately confided in her about his cancer and told her that his only wish was to see his grandson happy. Amara could not reject it anymore.

On the other side, little did Amara know how much Gustavo had done to make Tobias fall in love with her. He even threatened to make Celestine and her family homeless if Tobias couldn't treat Amara right. No one dared to doubt the word of the man in charge of the family, Celestine literally disappeared from their lives and Tobias accepted their marriage.

Tobias was a responsible husband in Amara's eyes. Until last month, he usually returned home on time and dined with her regularly. She still held faith in their marriage until she learned Celestine was back and Tobias spent most of his time with her for the past month.

Now, she realized it was all Tobias' revenge on her.

Her silent cell phone suddenly rang and it was from her best friend Melanie! She immediately picked up the phone, and Melanie's anxious voice came from the phone.

""Amara? Why is Tobias suddenly withdrawing his investment in my company?""

Amara immediately realized it was Tobias' threat. He was warning her to divorce! If she refused to sign the papers, he would use Melanie's company as his bargaining chip. Amara couldn't bear it anymore. Never in her life had she been so humiliated. She felt a fire burning inside her!

So it was Tobia's true colors! So shameless!

There was no more reason for her to stay in this marriage. She believed Gustavo would understand her decision, so she called Tobias at once.

Before he could speak, she immediately said, ""I agree to the divorce and I won't take any of your disgusting penny! Just prepare the divorce paper! RIGHT NOW!""

After saying that, she didn't wait for Tobias to respond and hung up the phone.

She immediately edited a text message to reassure Melanie. Even without Tobias, her company wouldn't lack investment.

Packing up her things, she left the Larsen Estate.

It was only after she felt a tiny wet drop land on her forehead, did she snapped out of her thoughts and took notice of her surroundings.

It was raining.

Tears flowed down her face, mingling with the rain as the sky seemed to mirror the state of her heart. But not a single sound escaped her lips.

She stood there, quietly letting her tears fall, her shoulders slumped, and her hair wet. Suddenly, she felt the rain stop where she stood.

She turned and saw the face of a familiar individual, a face ridiculed with concern.

""Ms. Crawford,"" Xavier, the exclusive butler of the Crawford greeted.

Amara didn't respond.

Instead, she let the man wrap a coat around her shoulders, damping out the chill nature of her wet dress, before he continued.

""The time limit given was about to expire. It's time for you to divorce Mr. Larsen and come home to manage the family business.""

""The Master is calling for your return as the one and only rightful ruler.""

# Chapter 3 Come Back Home.

""The family business…"" Amara muttered, laughing herself bitterly.

Well, a powerful Family Group was awaiting her back to manage yet she kept delaying it for someone who wasn't worthy of her love at all.

What did Tobias call her? A gold digger? If only he knew what family name she was born to have. The Crawford owned business everywhere in this world. If it weren't for the unexpected shipwreck, her fate would never have intersected with Tobias'.

Why should she keep on the wrong way? It was time to back home.

Seating into the black GMC Yukon, Amara picked up the call from her grandfather, Elvis Crawford.

""Grandfather, good evening."" She politely greeted, dipping her head subtly even though the man couldn't see her.

""Evening Amara,"" the old man asked directly. ""Have you finally decided to stop playing house?""

""Yes,"" Amara replied firmly, carrying the tone of an elite who had been trained by the finest tutors.

""I'll divorce Tobias Larsen and back home soon. But I have a request, I want more time to deal with something here first.""

The other end of the line was silent after her words, making her palms sweat.

Amara scrunched up her face. She just didn't want to disappear like the wind, making Tobias and Celestine think she was defeated.

""Please respect my decision Grandfather. I'm not coming home now. I don't want to leave like a loser. I want to build my name here before I go back home.""

It felt like an eternity passed before Elvis spoke, ""You know I especially hate when you disobey me,""

""I'm aware Grandfather. I apologize."" She apologetically bored her head, ready to accept whatever words her grandfather would throw at her. She knew she was being willful again.

""But you're right, there's no coward in our family. I'll give you a year to stay there as the manager of the London branch.""

""And in return, you must have raised the company's profit by thirty percent within a year.""

""What?! Grandfather, thirty percent, that's three billion!""

""And? Are you incapable of doing so?""

""No.""

""Good. But let me be frank, failure to do so would also have consequences.""

""Like?""

""I have a close friend of mine whose son is interested in you. I'm sure you both would make a wonderful couple.""

Amara's brows twitched. She understood the meaning in her grandfather's words perfectly well.

""An arranged marriage.""

""You were fine with the first one, weren't you? And let me tell you, unlike that bastard, Ah, I should have him castrated,"" Amara chuckled lightly at how her grandfather had trailed off topic. ""Unlike that bastard, Elijah is a fine man. He'd treat you well and-""

""That won't be necessary, Grandfather,"" Amara interrupted, politely. ""I'll raise the company's profit by Thirty percent, and then I won't need this marriage anymore.""

""Yes.""

""Alright then, Deal."" Amara agreed.

""I've done that much for granddaughter, so please, decease from disobeying me once all this has come to an end.""

""Yes, grandfather. Thank you.""

""Don't thank me. I have to attend my golf meeting now, rest well.""

""Have a nice time, Grandfather.""

Just like that, the call ended, leaving Amara alone with her thoughts.

One year, thirty percent profit.

Don't see her agreeing lightly, and only she herself knew how much pressure this would bring. During the past six years, Amara had abandoned her identity as well as talents only to be Tobias' wife wholeheartedly. But it all turned out to be a worthless daydream.

Yes, it was time to wake up. And she was not that generous to forgive everything.

""Xavier,"" she spoke, softly rubbing her temple with her fingers. ""Get ready to acquire the cosmetics company of Melanie Woods at once and make sure we're faster than the Larsen.""

""Yes, my lady,"" the man in the front seat replied respectfully. ""I'll definitely live up to your trust.""

Amara looked out of the car window and a smile curled on her lips. She knew her new life started.

\*\*\*

""Melanie, what are we doing here?"" Staring up at the huge club building in front of her, Amara couldn't help but feel puzzled.

She glanced to her side, finding Melanie who had just finished checking their attendance with the bodyguard, before she continued.

""You said we were going out…to celebrate.""

Melanie nodded her head. After learning that Amara had decided to divorce Tobias, Melanie couldn't wait to celebrate her best friend being single once again.

Amara agreed because being depressed for days over a dick like Tobias wasn't her thing. But now, staring at the rather flashy club in front of her, Amara was doubting she had made the right decision.

""Come on Mara,"" Melanie spoke as she pulled her by the wrist and into the club. ""Where else did you expect us to go while dressed like this?""

The moment Melanie said this, Amara passed by a floor-to-ceiling mirror and caught sight of her dressing for the second time this evening. Knee-length, tight, black leather gown, boots that stopped at her ankle, and a glistening golden necklace that highlighted the curves of her neck exposed by her wavy brown hair which was now pulled up into a tight ponytail.

She looked stunning, felt confident, and unlike the unappealing woman who had been married to Tobias for six awful years. And the stares she got the instant she walked into the club told her every bit of that was true.

""You're single now, Amara, we gotta celebrate that. Especially when it's you that's dumping that asshole.""

Amara chuckled, dryly, while Melanie ordered a third drink. She really admired her friend's hostility towards Tobias. It was on a whole other level, unlike her half-assed one.

""Four shots of whiskey for the two beautiful ladies."" The bartender announced as he came back with the drinks Melanie had ordered. When he placed them down, Amara sent the man an innocent smile that had him blushing like a high school geek.

""Even the bartender has it out for you,"" Melanie commented as she picked up the first shot and downed it, soon urging Amara to do the same.

""Just celebrate the single life, Mara!"" She cheered after their second shot, immediately hopping off the stool, pulling Amara with her in the process, and rushing into the dance floor.

Amara could only but chuckle at her friend's optimistic attitude. Melanie was clearly determined to see her have fun. And she was having fun, despite her gloomy mood, she had managed to keep a smile on her face the whole night.

But clearly, the universe had other plans for her.

As Amara and Melanie danced and swayed on the dance floor, a tall, lean individual dressed in a suit stepped into the club, beside him was a blonde beauty that quickly caught the eyes of many men in the club.

""Toby, where do you want to seat?"" Celestine asked as she wrapped her arms around his upper arm, acting innocent as she pressed her chest against his arm.

""Wherever is fine,"" Tobias responded, seemingly not disturbed by her actions.

Celestine didn't like that, but she knew better than to complain, because the moment she did so, or tried any harder, Tobias was sure to notice the shift in her innocent demeanor.

""How about there?"" She pointed to a spot beyond the dance floor.

Tobias followed the direction of her finger, but suddenly, something, no, someone caught his attention.

# Chapter 4 Fifty Million Pounds...

At the center of the dance floor was a familiar figure, dressed in a provocative black dress, swaying her hips to the rhythm of the music while laughing at the attention her current dance partner, a male in his late twenties, was showering her with.

Even though she looked noticeably different, seductive, alluring, and far from the usual humble aura she usually gave, Tobias had no trouble recognizing her. His wife. And the longer Tobias watched HIS wife shower in the attention of another man, the more irritated he grew.

""You can go on ahead."" He said without glancing at Celestine as he walked off, leaving her standing on her own.

""Tob-,"" Celestine was cut short, as Tobias had already walked away, his gaze focused on a particular figure, dancing on the dance floor.

He wasn't aware of how fast his strides were or how harshly his fist clenched. He wasn't aware of any of it until he found himself in front of his wife, and the man who had had his hands all over her for the past two minutes.

""What the fuck do you think you're doing?"" He snarled, his hand clamping tightly around her wrist and pulling her away from the man.

Amara was more than surprised to suddenly see Tobias. But the way he had pulled her, coupled with the tone of voice he had used, had her temper rising.

""Let go!"" She demanded with a glare after he had succeeded in pulling her off the dance floor and away from her dance partner.

But Tobias wasn't the least bit fazed. Instead, he simply tightened his grip, making her wince in pain.

""What the hell do you think you're doing here? Engaging publicly with another man while you're still married to me? Don't you have any sense of shame?""

Any sense of shame?

How dare this fcking bastard talk about that to her? When he was the shameless one who betrayed their marriage first!

If Amara wasn't as angry as she was, she'd have laughed.

She forcefully freed her wrist from his hold before fixing him with a glare.

""You're quite funny Tobias. The last time I checked, you were the one who wanted a divorce. And might I point out that a few days ago, you also shamelessly 'engaged' with another woman, my dearest husband?""

""So please, save your preaching for someone who hasn't seen your true colors."" Amara sneered and turned to leave but Celestine appeared.

""Toby, there you are-"" Her attention was quickly snagged by Amara and her eyes went wide upon seeing how she was dressed. ""A-Amara? What are doing here?""

""And how's that any of your business?"" Amara sneered, not bothering to hide the disgust in her voice.

Celestine flinched. ""I was simply-,""

""I didn't ask for your opinion."" Silencing the wench, Amara turned her attention back to Tobias. ""And you-""

He couldn't help but narrow his eyes at the disdain in her voice as she addressed him so rudely.

""I suggest you don't try to stick your nose into my business. We may be a married couple now, but in a few days,"" She snapped her finger. ""It'd all be over.""

""So focus more on your mistress, and not the person you'll be divorcing.""

""A-Amara,"" Celestine cut in with a coy tone to her voice. ""Please don't misunderstand, Tobias and I aren't together…""

Turning to Tobias, Celestine was practically glued to him, feigning kindness as she spoke. ""Toby, please don't be angry at Amara, she's simply overwhelmed and confused.""

""It should be a normal reaction seeing that as soon as you divorce her and she moves out of the sheltered doors of the Larsen home, she'd no longer have someone to fund her lifestyle. So it's normal for her to look for a man to fund her lifestyle.""

""Sheltered doors? Fund my lifestyle?"" Amara repeated with a chuckle. ""Oh, that's a new one, Celestine.""

""But she isn't wrong, is she?"" Tobias asked, his eyes narrowed and his voice cold as ice. Sure, he had no feelings for her, but that didn't mean he was fine with his wife sleeping around for penny change and potentially soiling his name.

Amara's brows creased at his reaction. Whenever Celestine was around, he had no brain to think wisely.

""Mind your own business, both you and your little slut.""

Amara didn't want to waste time with them anymore but Tobias gripped her hand again.

""Are you doing this only to challenge me? I see, you're doing all these just because I refused to give you no penny?""

""Well, fifty million pounds, I'll pay you that as divorce compensation, as long as you apologize to me and Celestine. Right this instant!""

His words were so arrogant and irritating that her lips curled upwards, a smile coming on her face, but the coldness in her eyes could rival the chill in Tobias's.

""Arrogant, aren't you?"" She smirked. ""Well, I'd have to bust that bubble of yours.""

Taking a step forward, she raised her head and looked her husband dead in the eyes.

""I already filed for a divorce, Tobias.""

""Trust me, your fifty million is nothing in my eyes. I will never bow to you and your bitch!""",1,2025-06-19 14:09:49,Novelnews,https://reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1lf5s2f/his_exwife_is_an_heiress_full_novel_summary/,ClownNipples
